# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Builder

Type: `oracle-oci`

The `oracle-oci` Packer builder is able to create new custom images for use
with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com) (OCI). The builder
takes a base image, runs any provisioning necessary on the base image after
launching it, and finally snapshots it creating a reusable custom image.

It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the [Key Concepts and
Terminology](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm)
prior to using this builder if you have not done so already.

The builder _does not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Authorization

The Oracle OCI API requires that requests be signed with the RSA public key
associated with your
[IAM](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm)
user account. For a comprehensive example of how to configure the required
authentication see the documentation on [Required Keys and
OCIDs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)
([Oracle Cloud
IDs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)).
Alternatively you can use [Instance
Principals](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)
in which case you don't need the above user authorization.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the `oracle-oci` builder. In
addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required

- `availability_domain` (string) - The name of the [Availability
  Domain](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm)
  within which a new instance is launched and provisioned. The names of the
  Availability Domains have a prefix that is specific to your
  [tenancy](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm#two).

  To get a list of the Availability Domains, use the
  [ListAvailabilityDomains](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/latest/AvailabilityDomain/ListAvailabilityDomains)
  operation, which is available in the IAM Service API.

- `base_image_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the [base
  image](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/References/images.htm)
  to use. This is the unique identifier of the image that will be used to
  launch a new instance and provision it.

  To get a list of the accepted image OCIDs, use the
  [ListImages](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Image/ListImages)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

- `compartment_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the
  [compartment](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Tasks/choosingcompartments.htm)

- `shape` (string) - The template that determines the number of CPUs, amount
  of memory, and other resources allocated to a newly created instance.

  To get a list of the available shapes, use the
  [ListShapes](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/ListShapes)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

- `subnet_ocid` (string) - The name of the subnet within which a new instance
  is launched and provisioned.

  To get a list of your subnets, use the
  [ListSubnets](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Subnet/ListSubnets)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

  Note: the subnet must be configured to allow access via your chosen
  [communicator](/docs/communicators) (communicator defaults to
  [SSH tcp/22](/docs/communicators/ssh#ssh_port)).

### Optional

- `use_instance_principals` (boolean) - Whether to use [Instance
  Principals](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)
  instead of User Principals. If this key is set to true, setting any one of the `access_cfg_file`,
  `access_cfg_file_account`, `region`, `tenancy_ocid`, `user_ocid`, `key_file`, `fingerprint`,
  `pass_phrase` will result in configuration validation errors.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `access_cfg_file` (string) - The path to the [OCI config
  file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).
  This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.
  Defaults to `$HOME/.oci/config`.

- `access_cfg_file_account` (string) - The specific account in the [OCI config
  file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) to use.
  This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.
  Defaults to `DEFAULT`.

- `region` (string) - An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region. Overrides value provided by the
  [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
  if present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `tenancy_ocid` (string) - The OCID of your tenancy. Overrides value provided by the [OCI config
  file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) if present.
  This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `user_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the user calling the OCI API. Overrides value provided by the
  [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
  if present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `key_file` (string) - Full path and filename of the OCI API signing key. Overrides value provided
  by the [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
  if present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `fingerprint` (string) - Fingerprint for the OCI API signing key. Overrides value provided by the
  [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) if
  present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `pass_phrase` (string) - Pass phrase used to decrypt the OCI API signing key. Overrides value provided
  by the [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
  if present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `image_name` (string) - The name to assign to the resulting custom image.

- `instance_name` (string) - The name to assign to the instance used for the image creation process.
  If not set a name of the form `instanceYYYYMMDDhhmmss` will be used.

- `use_private_ip` (boolean) - Use private ip addresses to connect to the
  instance via ssh.

- `metadata` (map of strings) - Metadata optionally contains custom metadata
  key/value pairs provided in the configuration. While this can be used to
  set metadata\["user_data"\] the explicit "user_data" and
  "user_data_file" values will have precedence. An instance's metadata can
  be obtained from at [http://169.254.169.254](http://169.254.169.254) on
  the launched instance.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to be used by cloud-init. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails)
  for more details. Generally speaking, it is easier to use the
  `user_data_file`, but you can use this option to put either the plaintext
  data or the base64 encoded data directly into your Packer config. Packer
  will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting
  down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file to be used as user data by
  cloud-init. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails)
  for more details. Example: `"user_data_file": "./boot_config/myscript.sh"`

- `tags` (map of strings) - Add one or more freeform tags to the resulting
  custom image. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm)
  for more details. Example:

```yaml
'tags':
  'tag1': 'value1'
  'tag2': 'value2'
```

- `defined_tags` (map of map of strings) - Add one or more defined tags for a given namespace to the resulting
  custom image. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm)
  for more details. Example:

```yaml
'tags':
  'namespace': { 'tag1': 'value1', 'tag2': 'value2' }
```

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. Note that account specific configuration has been
substituted with the letter `a` and OCIDS have been shortened for brevity.

```json
{
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_ocid": "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa",
