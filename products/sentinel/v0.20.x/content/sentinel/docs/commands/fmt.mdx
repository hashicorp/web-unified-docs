# Command: `fmt`

The `sentinel fmt` command formats a policy source to a canonical format.

## Usage

Usage: `sentinel fmt [options] FILE ...`

This command formats all the specified policy files to a canonical format.

By default, policy files are overwritten in place. This behavior can be
changed with the `-write` flag. If a specified FILE is `-` then stdin is
read and the output is always written to stdout.

The command-line flags are all optional. The list of available flags are:

- `-color` - Enable or disable colorized output. Enabled by default if
  running interactively.

- `-write=true` - Write formatted policy to the named source file. If false,
  output will go to stdout. If multiple files are specified, the output will
  be concatenated directly.

- `-check=false` - Don't format, only check if formatting is necessary. Files
  that require formatting are printed, and a non-zero exit code is returned if
  changes are required.
