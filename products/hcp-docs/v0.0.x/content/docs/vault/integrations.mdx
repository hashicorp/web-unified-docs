## Audit log streaming 

Audit logs keep a detailed log of all requests to Vault, and their responses. 
Because every operation with Vault is an API request/response, the audit log contains every interaction with the Vault API, including errors. 

<Note>

Audit log streaming is not available on Development tier clusters. 

</Note>

HCP Vault supports streaming audit logs to a variety of desintations. Please see the tutorials below for more details on setting up audit log streaming with HCP Vault.
