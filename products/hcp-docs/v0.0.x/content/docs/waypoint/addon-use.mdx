# Use an add-on to deploy supporting infrastructure

This page describes how to install an add-on onto an HCP Waypoint application using an add-on definition that has already been created. Application developers often perform this task. Refer to [Add-ons](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/add-ons) for additional information.

## Background

HCP Waypoint add-ons let application developers install supporting infrastructure to their application at any point in the application lifecycle. These components can be infrastructure or services, including databases, storage buckets, secrets engines, search engines, telemetry dashboards, and much more.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP Account. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.

1. From the HCP Waypoint overview, go to the **Applications** menu.
1. Select your application.

1. Click **Install an add-on**.
1. From the **Available add-ons** page, select the desired add-on you want to install for your application by clicking **Install** or **Install another**.

## Edit an add-on

After you create the add-on, you can only change the add-on name.
