# What is HCP Waypoint?

HCP Waypoint is a HashiCorp-managed application deployment platform that simplifies the process of deploying applications into your infrastructure and helps you standardize your deployment process.

HCP Waypoint helps app developers who are responsible for creating applications and the platform engineers responsible for maintaining the infrastructure the applications run on. These roles may overlap or align differently in your organization, but HCP Waypoint is intended to ease the workload for any practitioner responsible for either set of tasks.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Get Started with HCP Waypoint](/waypoint/tutorials/hcp-waypoint) collection to set up a HCP Waypoint template and add-on definitions, then use them to deploy a sample application and its supporting infrastructure.

## How does HCP Waypoint work?

HCP Waypoint integrates deeply with Terraform Cloud no-code modules to standardize infrastructure management and application deployments within your organization. This enables you to address challenges often associated with Day 0 and Day 1. Both platform engineers and application engineers can benefit from HCP Waypoint. 

There are two key workflows for HCP Waypoint: 

1. **Day 0 - Set up the templates:** Platform engineers create shared [application templates](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/application-templates) for deploying applications and their underlying infrastructure, and [add-on definitions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/add-ons) for common services. These standardized, shared templates, and add-on definitions codify the requirements from stakeholders across the organization including security, compliance, and finance. 

  HCP Waypoint templates and add-on definitions abstract the complexity of underlying infrastructure tooling, enabling app developers to deploy their applications using a  self-service model.

  Platform engineers need to [configure HCP Waypoint to interact with their Terraform Cloud organization](/hcp/docs/waypoint/configure-tfc-integration), [create and manage application templates](/hcp/docs/waypoint/template-create), and [create and manage add-on definitions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/addon-definition-create).

1. **Day 1 - Set up the application:** Application developers leverage the templates and add-ons created by the platform engineers to deploy applications and their supporting infrastructure. The platform team maintains the templates and add-ons, which allows application developers to focus on building applications using a repeatable process on standardized infrastructure.

  Application developers use [templates to deploy applications](/hcp/docs/waypoint/template-use), and use [add-ons to deploy supporting infrastructure and services](/hcp/docs/waypoint/addon-use) for the applications.

## Public beta limitations

HCP Waypoint is currently in public beta. Sign up to create an application in HCP Waypoint. The following constraints and limitations apply during the beta phase.

- HCP Waypoint does not have an SLA or production-grade guarantee of availability. We do not recommend using HCP Waypoint for critical applications.

- HCP Waypoint does not offer enterprise support. We provide best-effort support during business hours in US time zones. If you experience an issue with the HCP Waypoint that requires support, complete the [support request form](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to file a ticket.
