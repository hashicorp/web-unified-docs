# Integrate with GitHub Actions

HCP Vault Secrets allows users to automatically synchronize application secrets to GitHub.
This guide walks you through the configuration process.

## Prerequisites:

* Permissions to install GitHub applications
* An Admin role in an HCP Project
* An HCP Vault Secrets application and secret(s)

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the HCP Vault Secrets app you would like to integrate with GitHub. From the sidebar, select **Integrations**
   then click on the **GitHub Actions** card to initiate the setup in a second window.

1. Select where you want to install the [HCP Vault Secrets GitHub application](https://github.com/apps/hcp-vault-secrets).

1. Select the repositories you want to authorize HCP Vault Secrets to access. You can modify the list of authorized
   repositories at any time.

1. Click **Install & Authorize** to complete the installation. The window will close and the installation process will complete
   automatically on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform.

   <Note>
       If the installation process encounters an unexpected error, you can always uninstall the GitHub application in your
       GitHub settings and try again.
   </Note>

1. You will be presented with two fields:

   * **Organization** is the GitHub organization or user where the GitHub application was installed.
   * **Repository** is the list of repositories that HCP Vault Secrets is authorized to access. You can remove or add
   repositories at any time via your GitHub account settings.

1. Select the repository where you want to sync your app's secrets.

1. Once all fields are populated, click **Save and sync secrets** to complete the
   configuration process. It will immediately sync all your existing app secrets
   into your GitHub Repository Action Secrets.

## Limitations

* You can only create new GitHub sync integrations from HCP Vault Secrets, and they cannot be triggered from the GitHub marketplace.
* You can only sync secrets from a single HCP Project to GitHub. 
* You can only sync secrets to a single GitHub Organization.
