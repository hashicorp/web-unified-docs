# Delete a HashiCorp-managed cluster

Deleting HashiCorp-managed clusters removes them from the list of clusters in an HCP project. HashiCorp also deletes all managed resources associated with the cluster. User-managed components, such as services and client agents, lose Consul functionality but are not removed from their cloud environment.

## Delete a cluster

<Warning> When you delete a HCP Consul cluster, the snapshots associated with the cluster are also removed. It is not possible to recover snapshots after they are removed. If you intend to restore a cluster, [use an API call to download the snapshot](/consul/api-docs/snapshot) before you delete the cluster. When you restore it, the new clusterâ€™s name must match the name of the deleted cluster.</Warning>

To delete a HashiCorp-managed cluster using HCP, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).
1. Select the organization or project where you created the cluster you want to delete.
1. Click **Consul**.
1. From the Consul Overview, next to the cluster you want to delete, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then click **Delete**.
1. To confirm, enter `DELETE`. Then click **Delete**.

### Federated networks

When a HashiCorp-managed cluster is the primary datacenter in a WAN federated network, HCP does not allow you to delete the cluster if it is still federated with secondary datacenters. Delete all of the secondary datacenters in the federation first, then delete the primary datacenter.

### Cluster peering

When you delete a cluster that has an active cluster peering connection with another cluster, HCP removes all data related to the peering connection from clusters. This data includes imported and exported services between clusters. If you recreate a cluster after deleting it, you must complete the full process to re-establish a cluster peering connection, including exporting services and configuring service intentions between clusters.

Refer to [Establish cluster peering connections on HCP Consul](/hcp/docs/consul/extend/cluster-peering/establish) for more information.
