# Enable audit log streaming

HCP Packer supports near real-time streaming of audit events. Audit logs allow administrators to track user activity
and enable security teams to ensure compliance in accordance with regulatory requirements.

The following sections outline the steps required to enable and configure audit logs streaming to supported providers.
HCP Packer supports streaming audit logs to Datadog and Amazon CloudWatch. Note that you can only stream to one external account at a time.

~> **Note:** Audit Logs are only available for HCP Plus tier registries. [Learn more about HCP Plus](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/packer/pricing).

## Log retention

The HCP Packer platform stores audit logs for at least one year, and you can access logs for both active and deleted registries.

## Amazon CloudWatch

1. From the HCP Packer **Overview** page, select the **Audit Logs** view.
1. Click **Enable Log Streaming**.
1. From the **Enable audit logs streaming** view, select **Amazon CloudWatch** as the provider.
1. From the **Amazon CloudWatch** as the provider page, keep **AWS ID** and **External ID** handy. You would need that in the next steps.
1. [Create IAM Policy & Role](#aws-setup)
1. Under the **provider**, enter the **Destination name**, **Role ARN** (copied from the previous step), and select the **AWS region** where you are intend to store your data.
1. Click **Test connection** to receive a test event and confirm the connection has been established.
1. Click **Save**.

Logs should arrive within your Amazon CloudWatch in a few minutes of using Packer.

~> **Note:** We dynamically create the log group and log streams for you. You can find the log group in your
Amazon CloudWatch console with the prefix “/hashicorp” after setting up your configuration.
This allows you to easily distinguish which logs are coming from HashiCorp. Note that the log group for the test event differs from the log group for actual events.

Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) for details on log exploration.


## Datadog
~> **Note:** You need to know which region your Datadog account is in and have your Datadog [API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/) handy.

1. From the HCP Packer **Overview** page, select the **Audit Logs** view.
1. Click **Enable Log Streaming**.
1. From the **Enable audit logs streaming** view, select **Datadog** as the provider.
1. Under the **provider**, enter your **Destination name**, **API Key** and select the **Datadog site region** that matches your existing Datadog environment.
1. Click **Test connection** to receive a test event and confirm the connection has been established.
1. Click **Save**.

Logs should arrive within your Datadog environment in a few minutes of using Packer.
Refer to the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/logs/#explore-your-logs) for details on log exploration.

## Testing streaming configuration

During the streaming configuration setup, you can test that your streaming configuration works within HCP. Testing verifies that your credentials are correct and that other parameters on the configuration plan work. To test, enter the necessary parameters for the logging provider you wish to test, then click **Test connection** button.

HCP sends a test message to the logging provider and shares the success or failure status on the **Enable log streaming** page.

You can also test any updated streaming configurations to ensure they still work as intended.

## Updating streaming configuration

After configuring streaming, you could update your configuration for a variety of reasons. You may want to rotate a secret used for your logging provider, or switch logging providers altogether.

1. Select **Edit streaming configuration** from the **Manage** menu on the **Audit logs** page.
1. If you want to select a new provider, do so now.
1. Enter new parameters for the provider.
1. (Optional) Test the connection by clicking the **Test connection**.
1. Click **Save**.


## AWS Setup

As a part of the Amazon CloudWatch setup, you need to create an IAM Policy and Role. Refer following section to do that
per your preferred method.

Before starting these steps, you must have **AWS ID** and **External ID** from the HCP Packer Audit Logs page within your
[HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).


### AWS Management Console
1. [Create a new IAM policy using the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-start).
1. Choose the JSON option and copy and paste the policy below.

 ```json
 {
 	"Version": "2012-10-17",
 	"Statement": [
 		{
 			"Sid": "HCPLogStreaming",
 			"Effect": "Allow",
 			"Action": [
 				"logs:PutLogEvents",
 				"logs:DescribeLogStreams",
 				"logs:DescribeLogGroups",
 				"logs:CreateLogStream",
 				"logs:CreateLogGroup",
 				"logs:TagLogGroup"
 			],
 			"Resource": "*"
 		}
 	]
 }
 ```

1. Finish the rest of the setup to create and save policy.
1. [Create a new IAM role with the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).
1. Choose **AWS account** as your trusted entity type.
1. Select **Another AWS account** for the AWS account field.
1. Use **AWS ID** value from the HCP Packer Audit Logs page as your account ID.
1. From options, select **Require external ID**.
1. For External ID, use the **External ID** value from your HCP Packer Audit Logs page.
1. Finish the process of saving and creating your custom role.
1. Attach the policy that you created in the previous steps to this role.
1. Finish the role creation setup.
1. Copy the *ARN* of the role and go back to [Amazon CloudWatch](#amazon-cloudwatch) section to finish rest of the steps.
