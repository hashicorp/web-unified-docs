# Transit Gateway Attachments

You can create transit gateway attachments to connect a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) to an AWS transit gateway.
* A _transit gateway_ is an AWS component that acts as a network transit hub in your AWS environment.
* A _transit gateway attachment_ is a component in HCP that connects your HVN to a transit gateway in AWS.

## Overview

The following procedure describes how to connect clusters in HCP to resources deployed to AWS:
1. Connect one or more VPCs in your AWS network to your transit gateway.
1. Create a _resource share_ using the AWS Resource Access Manager. The transit gateway and resource share must exist in the same region as the HVN you want to connect to.
1. Create a transit gateway attachment in HCP. The platform identifies the shared resource using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the transit gateway ID.
1. HCP initiates a request to AWS for access to the resources. You must approve the attachment request in the AWS account before HCP can route traffic through the transit gateway.
1. Configure routes to direct traffic between the transit gateway attachment and the transit gateway.

You can create a transit gateway attachment in HCP or you can use the HCP Terraform provider. For instructions on how to create transit gateway attachments with Terraform, refer to the [HCP provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/aws_transit_gateway_attachment).

> **Tutorial**: For step-by-step guidance on using transit gateways to connect your HVN to AWS, refer to the [Connect an Amazon Transit Gateway to your HashiCorp Virtual Network tutorial](/hcp/tutorials/networking/amazon-transit-gateway).

## Requirements

Before you create a transit gateway attachment, you need the following information:

* AWS account ID
* AWS transit gateway ID
* ARN of the resource share in AWS

The HCP interface provides links and other onscreen assistance to help you find this information. For additional details on where to find this information, refer to the AWS Documentation.

## Create a Transit Gateway Attachment

The HCP interface provides guided steps to help you transit gateway attachments. You can follow the command line or the web UI workflow.

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](/hcp?utm_source=docs) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. Click **Transit gateway attachments** and then **Create attachment**.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Terminal">

1. In the **Terminal** tab, complete the requested fields:
    - In the **Attachment ID** field, enter a name for the peering connection.The name can be up to 36 characters and can only include letters, numbers, and dashes.
    - Enter your **AWS Account ID**.
    - Enter your **Transit gateway ID**.
    - Select your **VPC region**.
1. Copy the resource share command and run it in your terminal.
1. Enter your **Resource share ARN** and then click **Create attachment**.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Web console">

1. Click the **Web console** tab and complete the requested fields:
    - In the **AttachmentID field**, enter a name for the peering connection.The name can be up to 36 characters and can only include letters, numbers, and dashes.
    - Enter your **AWS Account ID**.
    - Enter your **Transit gateway ID**.
    - Select your **VPC region**.
    - Enter your **Resource share ARN**.
1. Click **Create attachment**.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps
After you create the attachment, you must create a route to direct traffic to your VPCs. For more information, refer to [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/routes).
