# Users

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account for the first
time, the HCP Portal takes you to the [create
organization](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/orgs/create) page to set up
your organization. You can invite additional users to the organization so that
they can access the resources.

This page describes how to add users to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account and manage their access to resources.

## Invite users

Use the following procedure to invite users into your organization using email.
[Organization admin role](#organization-role) is required to invite and manage
users.

<Note>

If [Single Sign-On](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso) is enabled, manage the users
through the configured identity providers instead. The option to manually invite
users as described in this section will not be available.

</Note>

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your
   organization.
1. Click **Access Control (IAM)** in the sidebar and click **+Invite user**.
1. Enter their email address and click **Add**. You can repeat this step to continue adding users.
1. Choose a role from the **Assign role** drop-down menu and click **Invite**. Refer to the [User Permissions](#user-permissions) for information about the roles you can assign.


## Manage users

You can remove user access or change roles from the **Users** screen. You must been assigned an admin role to invite and manage users.

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your
   organization.
1. Click **Access Control (IAM)** in the sidebar.
1. Click on a user name.
1. You can perform the following actions:
   * Click **Remove** to delete the user from your organization.
   * Choose a new role from the **Role** drop-down menu.
1. Click **Save**.

## User permissions

Depending on the assigned roles, users have different level of permissions to
perform actions in HCP.

<Note>

Users at the project level inherit permissions from the organization level.
Project-level permissions that are more permissive can override the
organization-level role. For example, you can assign a user _viewer_ role on the
organization level but assign a _contributor_ role to a particular project
within the organization.

   the user. Refer to the [project role](#project-role) tables for information
   about the roles you can assign.
