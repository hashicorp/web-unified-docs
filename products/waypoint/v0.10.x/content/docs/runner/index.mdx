# Waypoint Runners

Waypoint utilizes "runners" to execute operations. A runner is a program executing
[`waypoint runner agent`](/commands/runner-agent) that is configured with the details
of the Waypoint server.

Every operation that Waypoint runs (build, deploy, release, etc) is executed by a Waypoint runner.
The Waypoint server maintains a queue of jobs that the server hands out to connected
runners. The server never connects directly to runners, runners always connect to the
server. This is important because runners are designed to be run in the same
environment that your application is deployed into because the plugins such as Deploy
need to talk directly to your deployment platform APIs.

In most deployments, there are two kinds of runners:

### Static Runner

Static runners are long-lived runners that are installed into your deployment
environment once, likely when you setup Waypoint for the first time.

The [`waypoint install`](/commands/install) and [`waypoint runner install`](/commands/runner-install)
commands can install these runners for you, using details about your deployment
environment.

One issue with static runners is that they have fixed capacity: they can only run so
many operations at a time. Additionally to run certain plugins like Docker, we need to have
uniquely configured environments.

For that reason, Waypoint makes heavy usage of on-demand runners:

### On-Demand Runners

While the static runner is capable of performing operations on its own, it also
supports the ability to spawn on-demand runners for a given platform. These
on-demand runners are ephemeral container instances that perform one operation only.
They can perform container builds without any privileged access, offer more isolation
between operations, and allow Waypoint to scale further.

On-demand runners: see [on-demand runners](/docs/runner/on-demand-runner) for more information.

## Other Runners

One runner behavior is used less often, the CLI runner:

### CLI Runner

When you trigger an action with the CLI, i.e. by running `waypoint deploy`, the CLI acts as a runner
capable of performing your operation. If your deployment needs AWS credentials, or a valid kubectl context,
it can access the credentials on the developer workstation that it's running on.

If you only use Waypoint from the CLI, this is the only kind of runner that is used.

### Remote Runner

Not every operation in Waypoint needs to happen in response to a CLI invocation
from a privileged workstation. Waypoint can trigger deployments from the UI or
automatically based on git changes, or automatically poll the status of
applications in the background. In these cases, Waypoint needs a "remote
runner", a long-lived runner that is always available to run these operations.

Waypoint automatically installs a single remote runner by default when the Waypoint
server is installed with [`waypoint install`](/commands/install).

### On-demand runners

While the remote runner is capable of performing operations on its own, it also
supports plugins to spawn on-demand runners for a given platform. These
on-demand runners are ephemeral container instances that perform one operation
before exiting. These on-demand runners can perform container builds without
any privileged access, offer more isolation between operations, and allow
Waypoint to scale further.

On-demand runners: see [on-demand runners](/docs/runner/on-demand-runner) for more information.

This diagram shows a CLI runner, as well as remote static and on-demand runners:

## Runner Targeting

Runner targeting was designed with multi-environment and multi-region workflows in mind.
Static runners can be installed with user-defined ID and labels.
You can then set [runner profiles](/docs/runner/profiles), which tell the server which static runner to target to handle operations,
and the configurations of the short-lived on-demand runner that will execute jobs.
Finally, specify which `runner profile` to use for an application via
the `profile` option in the `runner` stanza of the `waypoint.hcl` file.

### Runner Targeting Example

Runners can have labels applied to them with the `-label` flag provided
alongside the `waypoint runner agent` command.

```terminal
$ waypoint runner agent -label=org=hashicorp -label=env=dev
```

After the runner has started, it can be adopted by the server for use in remote
operations. With `waypoint runner list`, you can see the full list of available
runners and their labels.

```shell-session
$ waypoint runner list
              ID             |  STATE   |  KIND  |         LABELS         | LAST REGISTERED
-----------------------------+----------+--------+------------------------+------------------
  01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH | pending  | remote | env:dev org:hashicorp  |

$ waypoint runner adopt 01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH
Runner "01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH" adopted.

$ waypoint runner list
              ID             |  STATE   |  KIND  |         LABELS         | LAST REGISTERED
-----------------------------+----------+--------+------------------------+------------------
  01G4N53X8DCJR3DJ9R56D6KZKH | adopted  | remote | env:dev org:hashicorp  |
```

With a runner that has labels applied, you can then create a runner profile to
target that runner (or runners). When this runner profile is used, Waypoint
will only generate on-demand runners using a runner whose labels match those
specified in the runner profile.

```terminal
$ waypoint runner profile set -name=docker-hashicorp-dev -plugin-type=docker -target-runner-label=org=hashicorp -target-runner-label=env=dev
âœ“ Runner profile created
```

```shell-session
                  NAME                  | PLUGIN TYPE |               OCI URL                |              TARGET RUNNER              | DEFAULT
----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+----------
  docker-hashicorp-dev                  | docker      | hashicorp/waypoint-odr:latest        | labels: {"env":"dev","org":"hashicorp"} |
```

In the `waypoint.hcl` file, you can specify the runner profile to use with the
`runner` stanza. In this example, a user variable "org" and the built-in
`workspace` variable are interpolated into the runner profile name, so that at
the time of execution of remote operations, Waypoint uses the desired runner
profile.

```hcl
project = "example-nodejs"

app "example-nodejs" {
  runner {
    profile = "docker-${var.org}-${workspace.name}"
  }

  build {
    # ...
  }

  deploy {
    # ...
  }

  release {
    # ...
  }
}

variable "org" {
  type = string
}
```

An operation which would use the runner profile created in this example could
be initiated with `waypoint build -w=dev -var=org=hashicorp -local=false`.

### Runner Targeting Advantages

The example above demonstrates basic usage of runner targeting. However, in a
production environment, runner targeting may be essential to achieving high
availability. Multiple runners could be deployed with the same labels, and
then a runner profile which targets runners with those labels would "round
robin" between the available runners. If one goes down, as long as another with
the same labels is still online, remote operations will continue to work.

Also shown in the above example is runner targeting for multi-environment
operations. The workspace of the operation dev, is interpolated into the runner
profile name dynamically at operation runtime. Additional runners and runner
profiles could be created for a "test" or "prod" environment so that a runner
can deploy to the right environment at runtime.

Runner targeting is useful for workflows where you deploy to multiple clusters
in a platform. For example, if you have a runner in one Kubernetes cluster,
that runner could potentially only perform remote operations within that
cluster. However, if there were a runner in multiple Kubernetes clusters, you
would have the ability to deploy to any of the clusters with Waypoint remote
operations by targeting the appropriate runners in each cluster.

## Disabling Runners

Runners can be disabled if desired. With runners disabled, Waypoint executes
all operations via the local CLI (even when communicating with a remote
[server](/docs/server)).

### Unavailable Functionality

With runners disabled, certain functionality becomes unavailable:

- Remote operations
- Git polling

In addition to disabled functionality, consider that all clients must now
have proper credentials for the target platforms (such as AWS, GCP, etc.)
since without runners they must execute all operations locally.

### Disabling Runner Installation

Prior to installation, runners can be disabled by specifying the
`-runner=false` flag to the [`waypoint install`](/commands/install) command.
This will not install a runner.

To uninstall a runner that is already installed, the only option today is
to uninstall and reinstall Waypoint with a
[data snapshot and restore](/docs/server/run/maintenance#backup-restore). You
may also manually go into your platform and delete the runner, but Waypoint
can't automate this for you today.

If there is a runner which you'd no longer like your server to use for remote
operations, this runner can be "invalidated" for use by the server with the
`waypoint runner forget` command, with the ID of the runner provided.
