# Logs

Terraform Enterprise logs directly to standard output and standard error. This
allows you to forward logs using native tooling for your deployment platform.

## Log location and format

The individual service logs are located within the
`/var/log/terraform-enterprise` directory inside the container.

```sh
/var/log/terraform-enterprise
├── atlas.log
├── nginx.log
├── sidekiq.log
└── vault.log
```

Each service log is a plain text file containing the logs for that service.

Logs are collated and logged to standard output in the following format.

```sh
==> /var/log/terraform-enterprise/atlas.log <==

## Log forwarding

Terraform Enterprise no longer includes Fluent Bit to forward logs. Instead,
you can forward logs using native tooling for your deployment platform.

### Docker

Docker supports a multitude of logging drivers. See the [Docker logging
driver](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/) list for what
options are available. 

### Kubernetes 

Kubernetes supports several architectures for log-forwarding. See the
[Kubernetes logging architectures documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures)
for what options are available.
