# Creating the initial admin user

Once Terraform Enterprise is installed and reporting healthy you can create the
initial admin user.

To create the initial admin user:

- If you configured `TFE_IACT_SUBNETS` in your docker compose or helm overrides, retrieve your initial admin creation token (IACT) from
`https://${TFE_HOSTNAME}/admin/retrieve-iact`. Otherwise, gain access to the container or pod command line and execute `curl  http://localhost:80/admin/retrieve-iact`. 

- Navigate to `https://${TFE_HOSTNAME}/admin/account/new?token=${IACT_TOKEN}`.

- Follow the prompts to create your initial admin user.

Now you are ready to run workloads on your Terraform Enterprise Flexible
Deployment Options installation.
