# Troubleshooting

This guide describes how to troubleshoot Terraform Enterprise.

## Health check

Terraform Enterprise provides a `/_health_check` endpoint on the instance. If
Terraform Enterprise is up, the health check will return a `200 OK`.

The `/_health_check` endpoint operates in 2 modes:

- Full check
- Minimal check

With a full check, the service will attempt to verify the status of internal
components and PostgreSQL, in contrast to a minimal check which returns `200
OK` automatically after a successful check.

The endpoint's default behavior is to perform a full check during startup of
the instance, and minimal checks after Terraform Enterprise is active and
running.

To force a full check, include the additional query parameter `?full=1`. This
parameter causes every call to make requests to internal components and
PostgreSQL, increasing system load and latency. Use it sparingly.

## Support bundles

A support bundle is a collection of logs and other information about your
installation that you can then send to HashiCorp Support for further
troubleshooting.

You can generate a support bundle using the `tfectl support bundle` command.
See the `tfectl`
[documentation](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments-beta/admin/admin-cli/admin-cli#support-bundle)
for more information.

### Support bundle contents

Support bundles contain the following information:

- Logs for all Terraform Enterprise services.
- License information for the installation.
- The Terraform Enterprise environment configuration with redacted secrets.
- Additional diagnostic information about the container, such as the contents
  of `/etc/hosts`, disk and memory usage, and network configuration.

Logs are available within the bundle under the `host` directory. All other
information is available within the `results.json` file located at the root of
the bundle.

## Terraform Enterprise services

When you encounter application issues, understanding the role of individual
services in Terraform Enterprise will help you troubleshoot.

- `archivist` - Object storage API which simplifies the service architecture
  and minimizes inner-network cross talk by colocating the logical storage and
  front-end API handler pieces.

- `atlas` - The Terraform Enterprise API.

- `atlas-ui` - The Terraform Enterprise user interface.

- `backup-restore` - A tool that provides both an API to backup and restore a
  Terraform Enterprise backup snapshot and a command line tool to inspect a
  backup snapshot. A backup snapshot is an encrypted binary file containing the
  Archivist data, Vault transit keys, and PostgreSQL schema dumps for a given
  Terraform Enterprise instance.

- `licensing` - A library and service that provides enterprise license
  functionality for Terraform.

- `metrics` - A Terraform Enterprise component to aggregate metrics and expose
  them over HTTP and HTTPS.

- `nginx` - The NGINX reverse proxy which facilitates access to the Terraform
  Enterprise services.

- `outbound-http-proxy` - Security control used to filter user-controlled
  network traffic (e.g. sentinel imports) and prevent them from accessing
  internal services directly.

- `postgres` - The PostgreSQL database holds relational data such as workspace
  applies and where their state is stored in object storage. An internal
  PostgreSQL service is started when the operational mode is `disk`. PostgreSQL
  server host config must be provided for `active-active` mode.

- `redis` - An in-memory database, use for caching and `sidekiq` queue. An
  internal Redis service is started when the operational mode is `disk` or
  `external`. Redis server host config must be provided for `active-active`
  mode.

- `registry_api` - Terraform Private Module Registry API.

- `sidekiq` - Background job scheduler system.

- `slug-ingress` - Listens for VCS webhooks. Packages VCS repo data as a slug
  and sends it to `archivist`.

- `task-worker` - A service that manages asynchronous units of work in
  Terraform Enterprise.

- `terraform-registry-api` - The API to the Terraform Registry.

- `terraform-registry-worker` - Processes VCS slugs and prepares modules to be
  published on the Terraform private Module Registry.

- `terraform-state-parser` - Reads Terraform state files and parses important
  information out of them. Terraform state is consumed from a remote state URL,
  and compiled data is sent in the payload of a callback to Atlas.

- `tfe-health-check` - This tool is to help our customers and us know exactly
  why Terraform Enterprise has gotten into an unhealthy state, checking the
  health and connections to Postgres, Redis, Vault, storage, etc.

- `vault` - HashiCorp Vault utilizes transit encryption for items such as
  sensitive workspace variables.

## Service status

To check the status of the services, execute the following command within
Terraform Enterprise container.

```bash
$ supervisorctl status
```

You will receive output similar to the following.

```sh
$ supervisorctl status

logs                             RUNNING   pid 39, uptime 1:38:49
postgres                         RUNNING   pid 103, uptime 1:38:48

tfe:terraform-state-parser       RUNNING   pid 291, uptime 1:38:46
tfe:tfe-health-check             RUNNING   pid 298, uptime 1:38:46
tfe:vault                        RUNNING   pid 309, uptime 1:38:46
tfe-next                         RUNNING   pid 40, uptime 1:38:49
```

## Inspecting logs

To inspect the logs for a particular service, execute the following command
within the Terraform Enterprise container where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of a
Terraform Enterprise service.

```sh
$ cat /var/log/terraform-enterprise/SERVICE_NAME.log
```

For example, we can see why `tfe:licensing` exited.

```sh
$ cat /var/log/terraform-enterprise/licensing.log
{"@level":"info","@message":"initializing database","@module":"tfe-licensing","@timestamp":"2023-05-10T20:46:26.379084Z"}
{"@level":"error","@message":"error opening database connection","@module":"tfe-licensing","@timestamp":"2023-05-10T20:46:26.399064Z","error":"failed to connect to `host=/var/run/postgresql user=terraform-enterprise database=`: server error (FATAL: role \"terraform-enterprise\" does not exist (SQLSTATE 28000))"}
```

## Kubernetes

### Debug mode

Terraform Enterprise dispatches plans and applies via jobs when running inside Kubernetes. These jobs are removed immediately
after their execution, which can make it hard to understand if a job failed due to cluster-specific errors.

To make troubleshooting easier in these scenarios, it is possible to keep the kubernetes jobs alive for a limited period of time,
after which they will get garbage collected by the cluster. To enable this, provide the following environment variables to
the deployment, either via the `env.variables` entry in the `values.yaml` override, or via the `ConfigMap` attached to the
deployment holding all of the environment variables.

* `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_KUBERNETES_DEBUG_ENABLED`. Boolean flag to enable debug mode, set to `true`.
* `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_KUBERNETES_DEBUG_JOBS_TTL`. (Optional) time in seconds after which the jobs will get deleted; default is `86400`.

## Troubleshooting common application errors

This section covers common application errors that you may run into.

### Kubernetes Fails to Pull Image

#### Symptom

Kubernetes pods are failing to pull the container image with a `BackOff` error.

#### Signals

`kubectl describe pod` is stuck in the `Waiting` state with the `ErrImagePull`
reason.

```sh
$ kubectl describe pod terraform-enterprise-7f649f6598-2k79b
...
Containers:
  terraform-enterprise:
    State:          Waiting
      Reason:       ErrImagePull
...
```

#### Solution

Update the image pull policy for the deployment to `always`.

### Empty S3 static credentials

#### Symptom

Application fails to start.

#### Signals

Logs show the following S3 prefix detection error.

```sh
2023-05-10T23:38:18.100Z [ERROR] terraform-enterprise: startup: error="failed detecting s3 prefix: could not list objects: operation error S3: ListObjectsV2, failed to sign request: failed to retrieve credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials, static credentials are empty"
```

#### Solution

Set `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_USE_INSTANCE_PROFILE` to `true` when using IAM auth
for S3.

### Unknown certificate with VCS integration

#### Symptom

You cannot configure a VCS connection within Terraform Enterprise.

#### Signals

Setting up VCS fails with `unknown certificate issuer` error.

#### Solution

Include the CA certificate for your VCS server in the CA Bundle. Ensure the
`TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` is set to a path pointing to your CA bundle.

### Unknown certificate with failing Terraform runs

#### Symptom

Terraform plans and applies fail.

#### Signals

Logs for task worker and archivist show an x509 error.

#### Solution

Include the CA certificates for all hosts that Terraform must communicate with,
including your Terraform Enterprise server itself, in the CA Bundle. Ensure the
`TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` is set to a path pointing to your CA bundle.

### Unable to fetch Terraform binary

#### Symptom

Terraform plans and applies fail with `failed downloading terraform`.

#### Signals

Terraform run logs contain.

```sh
Operation failed: failed fetching Terraform: failed downloading terraform: failed downloading "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.2/terraform_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip": GET https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.2/terraform_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip giving up after 5 attempt(s): failed making temp file: open /tmp/terraform/8c23e18ed1846a552fc22ed5ee80eec9.download-67d5219a-aa5c-cd41-3262-2b9d57c1bfe2: read-only file system
```

#### Solution

Ensure the `TFE_DISK_CACHE_PATH` location is properly backed by a writable
volume.
