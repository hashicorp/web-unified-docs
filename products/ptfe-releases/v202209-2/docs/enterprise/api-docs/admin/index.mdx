# Terraform Enterprise Admin API Documentation

-> **Terraform Enterprise Only:** The admin API is exclusive to Terraform Enterprise, and can only be used by the admins and operators who install and maintain their organization's Terraform Enterprise instance.

Terraform Enterprise provides an API to allow administrators to configure and support their installation.

## Authentication

With the exception of the [user impersonation endpoints](/enterprise/api-docs/admin/users#impersonate-another-user), all requests must be authenticated with a bearer token belonging to a site administrator. Use the HTTP Header `Authorization` with the value `Bearer <token>`. This token can be generated or revoked on the [tokens tab of the user settings page](/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens). In the context of the Admin API, your token has management access to all resources in the system.

For more information on authentication behavior, refer to [the API overview section](/enterprise/api-docs/#authentication).
