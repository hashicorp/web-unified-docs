## Imporant Information

### Merge branch

Make sure you create your PR against the correct **base** branch. Refer to
GitHub's [Change the branch range and destination repository guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository) for how to
select the base branch when creating a pull request.

If your content is an update to:

- Currently published content

  Choose **base: main** when you are updating published documentation, and you
  want your changes published when the PR is merged. We publish Nomad content
  from the `main` branch.
- Upcoming Nomad release

  Choose the branch for the Nomad release that your content is for. Nomad
  release branches use the `nomad/<exact-release-number>` format. If you are not
  able to find the upcoming Nomad release branch that you are looking for,
  contact the tech writer that works with the Nomad team.

### Backports

This repo stores previous version docs in folders instead of branches. There are
no backport labels.  If you backported your code PR to previous branches, update
the docs content in the corresponding folders. For example, if the current
release is 1.10.x and you backported your code to 1.9.x and 1.8.x, update the docs content
in the v1.10.x, v1.9.x, and v1.8.x folders.

## Links

merged.
Jira: [<jira-ticket-number>]
GitHub Issue: <issue-link>

The bot does publish a root-level link to the deploy preview, but it's nice to include a direct link to your content so the reviewers don't have to navigate to your pages.
