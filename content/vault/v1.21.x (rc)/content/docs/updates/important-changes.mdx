# Important changes

**Last updated**: 2025-10-04

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.

## Breaking changes

@include '../../../global/partials/important-changes/breaking-changes/client-count-timestamp.mdx'

### Audiences required for Kubernetes authentication roles ((##k8-audience-required))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.21.0           | All

All tokens for Kubernetes authentication roles must provide explicit audience
details. Vault validates the audience claim in the JWT token to ensure that the
token is actually intended for Vault and not another service.

If you do not provide an audience, authentication fails.

#### Recommendation

Update your Kubernetes authentication roles to include the audience parameter.
For example:

```shell-session
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/demo \
    bound_service_account_names=myapp \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=default \
    ttl=1h
```

Refer to the [Kubernetes authentication docs](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) for
more information.

## Known issues

### Missed events with multiple event clients ((#missed-events)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue | 1.21.0+ent       | None

Users may miss events when multiple clients subscribe to the same performance
standby node in a cluster with the same namespace and event type filters because
one client disconnecting effectively unsubscribes the remaining clients who no
longer receive events.

#### Recommendation

If you have multiple event subscribers with the same namespace and event type
filters you have two options:

1. Spread them out among the nodes of the Vault cluster.
1. Only subscribe to events on the active node of the cluster.
