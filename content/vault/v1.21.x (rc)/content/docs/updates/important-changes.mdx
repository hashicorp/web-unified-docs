# Important changes

**Last updated**: 2025-10-04

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.

## Breaking changes

### Audiences required for Kubernetes authentication roles (##k8-audience-required)

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.21.0           | All

All tokens for Kubernetes authentication roles must provide explicit audience
details. Vault validates the audience claim in the JWT token to ensure that the
token is actually intended for Vault and not another service.

If you do not provide an audience, authentication fails.

#### Recommendation

Update your Kubernetes authentication roles to include the audience parameter.
For example:

```shell-session
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/demo \
    bound_service_account_names=myapp \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=default \
    ttl=1h
```

Refer to the [Kubernetes authentication docs](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) for
more information.
