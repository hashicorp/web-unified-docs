Snapshot load and unload operations are restricted to the root namespace. All other snapshot operations 
	can be performed in other namespaces. 

1. Open the Vault GUI and sign in to the root namespace. While you can perform
other snapshot operations from any namespace, you must perform load and
	   unload operations under the `root` namespace.

1. Select **Secrets Recovery** from the left navigation menu.

1. Select **Upload snapshot**.

1. Select your upload method. To use an automated snapshot you must provide an
	   [automated snapshot config](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautosnapshots#load-a-snapshot-from-an-automated-snapshot-configuration).

1. Click **Load snapshot** to complete the upload.

1. Monitor the upload until the status says "Ready" and the expiration date
	   populates.
