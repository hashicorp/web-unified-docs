<Warning title="Cannot recover discrete data from disabled mounts">

  You cannot read, list, or recover information from a snapshot for disabled
  mount paths. Even if you re-enable the same plugin at the same path, Vault
  treats it as a new mount with different internal identifiers and cannot
  associate the re-enabled mount with the underlying storage entries within the
  snapshot.

</Warning>
