### Reordering of JSON output in audit log ((#audit-fields-reorder))
| Change | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Breaking | 1.16.0+ | Consumers of the audit log that relied on a fixed field order in JSON output

In Vault 1.16.0 and onwards we order the contents of an audit log entry alphabetically by JSON key.
This can affect consumers of the audit log, like Splunk, which might rely on timestamps appearing in consistent places.

#### Recommendation
Validate parsing of Vault audit logs prior to upgrading.
