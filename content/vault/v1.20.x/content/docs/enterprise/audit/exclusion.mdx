# Exclusion syntax for audit data

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

As of Vault 1.18.0, you can enable audit devices with an `exclude` option to exclude
specific fields in an audit entry that is written to a particular audit log, and fine-tune
your auditing process.

<Warning title="Proceed with caution">

  Excluding audit entry fields is an advanced feature. Use of exclusion settings
  could lead to missing data in your audit logs.

  **Always** test your audit configuration in a non-production environment
  before deploying exclusions to production. Read the
  [Vault security model](/vault/docs/internals/security) and
  [filtering overview](/vault/docs/concepts/filtering) to familiarize yourself
  with Vault auditing and filtering basics before enabling audit devices that use
  exclusions.

</Warning>

Once you enable an audit device with exclusions, every audit entry Vault sends to
that audit device is compared to an (optional) condition in the form of a predicate expression.
Vault checks exclusions before writing to the audit log for a device. Vault modifies
any audit entries that match the exclusion expression to remove the fields
specified for that condition. You can specify multiple sets of condition and field
combinations for an individual audit device.

When you enable audit devices that use exclusion, the behavior of any existing audit
device and the behavior of new audit devices that **do not** use exclusion remains
unchanged.

## `exclude` option

The value provided with the `exclude` option must be a parsable JSON array (i.e. JSON or
an escaped JSON string) of exclusion objects.

### Exclusion object

- `condition` `(string: <optional>)` - predicate expression using
  [filtering syntax](/vault/docs/concepts/filtering). When matched, Vault removes
  the values identified by `fields`.
- `fields` `(string[] <required>)` - collection of fields in the audit entry to exclude,
identified using [JSON pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) syntax.

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "",
    "fields": [ "" ]
  }
]
```

Vault always compares exclusion conditions against the original, immutable audit
entry (the 'golden source'). As a result, evaluating a given condition does not
affect the evaluation of subsequent conditions.

### Exclusion examples

#### Exclude response data (when present)

Exclude the response `data` field from any audit entry that contains it:

```json
[
  {
    "fields": [ "/response/data" ]
  }
]
```

#### Exclude request data (when present) for transit mounts

Exclude the request `data` field for audit entries with a mount type of `transit`:

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "\"/request/mount_type\" == transit",
    "fields": [ "/request/data" ]
  }
]
```
#### Multiple exclusions

Use multiple JSON objects to exclude:

* `data` from both the request and response when the mount type is `transit`.
* `entity_id` from requests where the `/auth/client_token` starts with `hmac`
  followed by at least one other character.

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "\"/request/mount_type\" == transit",
    "fields": [ "/request/data", "/response/data" ]
  },
  {
    "condition":  "\"/auth/client_token\" matches \"hmac.+\"",
    "fields": [ "/auth/entity_id" ]
  }
]
```
