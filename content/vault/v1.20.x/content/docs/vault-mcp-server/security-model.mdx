# Security model for Vault MCP server

This document explains the security model for the Vault Model Context Protocol (MCP) server when operating the server locally.
Understanding this model helps you safely integrate local AI agents with Vault tooling.
This ensures the following outcomes, even in local environments:

- Tool execution is safe and controlled
- Sensitive operations are protected from accidental misuse or injection
- LLM behavior is constrained and auditable prior to application.
