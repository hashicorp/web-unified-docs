# Kubernetes integrations comparison

HashiCorp Vault provides four different integrations to help Kubernetes workloads consume secrets from Vault without modifying application code. Each integration has unique characteristics that make it suitable for different use cases.

Use the information below to compare the available integrations and choose the right solution for your needs.

## Vault Secrets Operator

The [Vault Secrets Operator](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso) synchronizes secrets from Vault to native Kubernetes Secrets. 
It operates by watching Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and syncing secret data from Vault to Kubernetes Secrets, which applications can consume using standard Kubernetes patterns.

**Best for:** Teams who prefer native Kubernetes workflows and want durable secret storage within the cluster.

## Vault Secrets Operator CSI Driver

The [Vault Secrets Operator CSI Driver](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/vso-csi) mounts secrets directly from Vault to application containers as volumes, bypassing Kubernetes Secrets entirely. 
This integration requires **Vault Enterprise**.

**Best for:** Enterprise environments that want to avoid storing secrets in Kubernetes Secrets and etcd while maintaining efficient secret delivery.

## Vault Secrets Store CSI Provider

The [Vault Secrets Store CSI Provider](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/csi) uses the vendor-neutral [Secrets Store CSI driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/) to mount secrets from Vault as ephemeral volumes. 
The provider runs Vault Agent alongside the CSI driver for authentication and secret retrieval.

**Best for:** Organizations using multiple secret stores in addition to Vault, or those who prefer vendor-neutral CSI standards.

## Vault Agent Injector

The [Vault Agent Injector](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector) injects Vault Agent sidecar containers into pods. 
The Agent containers authenticate with Vault and render secrets to a shared memory volume for consumption by application containers.

**Best for:** Applications requiring dynamic secret rotation or direct Vault Agent functionality.


## Use case recommendations

The appropriate integration for your environment depends on the applicable
security policies, secret data governance, ease of use requirements, and
system availability guarantees.

## Performance considerations

Performance characteristics vary significantly between integrations based on
their architectural patterns.

<Tabs>
	
	<Tab heading="Load on Vault">
	
	- **Vault Secrets Operator** - Lowest load due to per-CRD connections and
	   cluster-local caching.
	- **Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver** - Low to medium load with per-node
	   connections.
	- **Secrets Store CSI provider** - Higher load due to per-pod connections.
	- **Agent Injector** - Highest load due to per-pod connections and sidecar
	   pattern.
	
	</Tab>
	
	<Tab heading="Secret availability">
	
	Integrations that use ephemeral storage have variable availability because
	secret access depends on Vault availability.
	
	
	- **Vault Secrets Operator CSI Driver** - Variable availability.
	- **Secrets Store CSI Provider** - Variable availability.
	- **Agent Injector** - Variable availability.
	- **Vault Secrets Operator** - Best availability. Kubernetes Secrets act
	  as durable cache.
	
	</Tab>
	
	<Tab heading="I/O, CPU, and memory consumption">
	
	- **Vault Secrets Operator** - Low consumption.
	- **Vault Secrets Operator CSI Driver** - Low consumption.
	- **Secrets Store CSI Provider** - Medium consumption.
	- **Agent Injector** - High consumption due to the number of sidecar containers
	  per pod.
	
	</Tab>
	
	<Tab heading="Scalability">
	
	Integrations that share secret data across pods scale well as the number of pods
	increase. Integrations that create independent Vault connections for each pod do
	not scale well as the number of pods increase.
	
	- **Vault Secrets Operator** - shares secret data.
	- **Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver** - shares secret data.
	- **Secrets Store CSI provider ** - creates independent Vault connections.
	- **Agent Injector** - creates independent Vault connections.

## Migration paths

## Migration requirements 

- Migrating **to** Vault Secrets Operator requires:
    1. Creating CRDs for each relevant secret type. For example, `VaultStaticSecret`, `VaultPKISecret`.
    1. Updating applications to use Kubernetes Secrets.

- Migrating **to** Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver requires:
    1. A Vault Enterprise license.
    1. Creating a `CSISecrets` CRD.
    1. Updating pod specifications to use CSI volumes.

- Migrating **from** Vault Agent Injector may require updating your secret
  templates to use the `SecretTransformation` resource.
