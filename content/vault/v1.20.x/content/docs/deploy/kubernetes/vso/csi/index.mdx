# Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver

While the Vault Secrets Operator allows for Vault secrets to be stored in the cluster as native Kubernetes Secrets, 
the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver allows for mounting Vault secrets directly to containers, bypassing Kubernetes Secrets altogether.

## Secrets flow: Traditional VSO vs CSI driver

A [Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) (CSI) is a standardized approach to managing pod volumes in Kubernetes. 
Running the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver can provide Vault Enterprise users the ability to fetch secrets 
from Vault and mount them directly to their containers as volumes.

By hooking into the pod volume lifecycle, the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver can deliver Vault secrets to users seeking to avoid the use of Kubernetes Secrets in their workflows.

Secrets flow for the traditional Vault Secrets Operator:

Secrets flow for the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver:

The Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver operates by watching for the creation or modification of a Custom Resource (CR) called a `CSISecrets`.
The [CSISecrets](/vault/docs/deploy/kubernetes/vso/api-reference#csisecrets) resource contains a declarative list of secrets to fetch, as well as access control configuration to allow only certain pods to be able to mount those secrets.

When an approved pod's spec references a volume with the same name as a CSISecrets resource, the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver will populate 
any containers in that pod (that are referencing the volume) with the secrets declared in that CSISecrets resource.

## Features

The following features are supported by the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver:

- Support for syncing multiple secrets from multiple secret engine mounts
- Automatic generation and mounting of response-wrapped AppRole Secret IDs, allowing the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver to be a [trusted orchestrator](/vault/tutorials/app-integration/secure-introduction?in=vault%2Fapp-integration#trusted-orchestrator) for credentials to authenticate application pods to Vault
- Support for installation using `Helm`<br />
*see the [installation](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/installation) docs for more details*
- Support for [secret data transformation](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/secret-transformation).

## Supported secret sources

The Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver supports syncing of:
* KV-v1 and KV-v2 secrets
* Secret IDs for the AppRole auth method
