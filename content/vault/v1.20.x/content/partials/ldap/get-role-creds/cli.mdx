Use `vault read` with the
[`/{mount_path}/static-cred/{role_name}`](/vault/api-docs/secret/ldap#static-role-passwords)
path to fetch the credential information for the given role:

```shell-session
$ vault read <mount_path>/static-role/<role_name>
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault read devcreds/static-role/hashicorp
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
