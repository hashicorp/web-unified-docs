The Vault server currently running on the first pod (`vault-0`) is configured
as a high-availability cluster but only running a single node. To create a true
high-availability cluster, you need to spin up additional nodes.

1. Create a variable named `CLUSTER_ROOT_TOKEN` to capture the Vault unseal key:

   ```shell-session
   $ CLUSTER_ROOT_TOKEN=$(cat cluster-keys.json | jq -r ".root_token")
   ```

1. Use the Kubernetes CLI to run `vault login` to log into Vault with the root
   token on your first pod. For example, to log into Vault on `vault-0`:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec vault-0 -- \
      vault login ${CLUSTER_ROOT_TOKEN}
   ```

1. Use the Kubernetes CLI to run the Vault CLI `raft list-peers` command to list
   the available nodes:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec vault-0 -- \
      vault operator raft list-peers

   Node        Address        State     Voter
   ----        -------        -----     -----
   vault-0     127.0.0.2:8201 leader    true
   vault-1     127.0.0.3:8201 follower  true
   vault-2     127.0.0.4:8201 follower  true
   ```

1. Use the Kubernetes CLI to run the Vault CLI `raft join` command to join
   additional nodes to the Vault cluster. For example, to add the Vault server
   on `vault-1`:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec vault-1 -- \
      vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200
   ```

1. New nodes join the cluster sealed. Repeat the unseal process for each new
   node using `vault operator unseal`. For example, to unseal the server on
   `vault-1`:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec vault-1 -- \
      vault operator unseal $VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY
   ```

<Warning title="Revoke root tokens after setup">

   [Root tokens](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#root-tokens) let users perform any
   operation on any path. We strongly recommend only using privileged tokens for
   the initial setup of a cluster. As part of the setup, you should configure
   at least one alternative authentication method and a basic access policy.
   Once you verify the alternative authentication method works, we recommend
   revoking the root token.
