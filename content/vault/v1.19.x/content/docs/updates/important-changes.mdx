# Important changes

**Last updated**: 2025-09-12

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.


### Rotation manager schedule strings in UTC ((#rotation-manager-utc))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| New behavior | 1.19.11+         | Enterprise

Vault interprets `rotation_schedule` strings relative to UTC to match the
behavior of static role rotations in the database plugin. Old rotations use
their existing schedule until you manually update rotation with an API call.
