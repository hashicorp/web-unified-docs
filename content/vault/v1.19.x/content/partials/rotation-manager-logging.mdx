### Rotation logging

The rotation manager emits logs to the standard `vault.log` on any successful or
failed rotation.

In the case of success, Vault notes:

- the rotated credential as the first parameter, `rotationID`.
- the anticipated time of the next rotation as `expire_time`.

In the case of failure, Vault sets `rotationID` to `err` and may emit additional
logs depending on the configured log level.
