# Plugin Portal

This page contains a curated collection of official, partner, and community
[Vault plugins](/vault/docs/internals/plugins).

For more information about plugin development, refer to this [documentation
section](/vault/docs/internals/plugins#plugin-development) and this [Learn
Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/developer/plugin-backends).

## Official

Official plugins are supported and maintained by HashiCorp.
Unless indicated otherwise, these plugins are available directly in the Vault
binary, but they can also be built and registered to Vault as external plugins
if necessary.

If a plugin exists separately under its own repository, follow the instructions
within that repository to develop, test, and build the plugin. If a repository
exists within the Vault repository, the plugin can be built as instructed in
[here](/vault/docs/internals/plugins#built-in-plugins).
