Use `vault lease renew` with the full lease ID of the service account
to extend the lease on a service account:

```shell-session
$ vault lease renew \
  <mount_path>/library/<set_name>/check-out/<lease_token>
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault lease renew \
  devcreds/library/accounting-team/check-out/0C2wmeaDmsToVFc0zDiX9cMq
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
