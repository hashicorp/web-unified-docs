Use `vault write` with the
[`{mount_path}/library/{set_name}`](/vault/api-docs/secret/ldap#library-set-management)
path to apply your `library.json` configuration file:

```shell-session
$ vault write <mount_path>/library/<set_name> @library.json
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault write devcreds/library/accounting-team @library.json
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
