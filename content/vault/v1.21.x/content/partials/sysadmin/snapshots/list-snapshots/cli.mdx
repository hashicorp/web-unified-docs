You can check to see if there is a snapshot currently loaded by using `vault list` 
and the `/sys/storage/raft/snapshot-load` endpoint:

```shell-session
$ vault list /sys/storage/raft/snapshot-load
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="10">

```shell-session
$ vault list /sys/storage/raft/snapshot-load
