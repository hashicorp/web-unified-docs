By default, application containers in the client pod are not aware of the Vault
cluster. You can use the Vault Injector service to read
[annotations](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector#annotations), find the
associated secret path in Vault, and mount a text file within the pod with the
secret information.

<Tip title="Format data with templates">

   Apply a
   [template](/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-sidecar#apply-a-template-to-the-injected-secrets)
   to the secret file to ensure the data meets the needs of your application.
