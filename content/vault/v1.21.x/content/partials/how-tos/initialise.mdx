Vault starts [sealed](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#why) and 
[uninitialized](/vault/docs/commands/operator/init). Before Vault can receive
data, you need to initialization the new storage backend and use the provided
keys to unseal Vault.

<Warning title="Use more than one unseal key in production">

   The steps below demonstrate the unseal process with a single key.  In
   production systems, we recommend a minimum of five unseal keys with an unseal
   threshold of three keys.

</Warning>

1. Use the Kubernetes CLI to run `vault operator init` and initialize Vault and
   write the unseal keys to `cluster-keys.json`. For example, the following
   command initializes the first pod in the `vault` cluster:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec vault-0 --  \
      vault operator init     \
       -key-shares=1          \
       -key-threshold=1       \
       -format=json > cluster-keys.json
   ```

1. Create a local environment variable named `VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY` to capture the
   Vault unseal key from `cluster-keys.json`:

   ```shell-session
   $ VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY=$(cat cluster-keys.json | jq -r ".unseal_keys_b64[]")
   ```

1. Use the Kubernetes CLI to run `vault operator unseal` and unseal the Vault
   instance running on your first pod. For example, to unseal the Vault instance
   on `vault-0`:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec vault-0 -- \
      vault operator unseal ${VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY}
   ```
