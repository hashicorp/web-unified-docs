<Note>

When using MongoDB with Ops Manager (or Cloud Manager) for user management, Ops Manager may
revert changes made by Vault, preventing Vault for properly managing and rotating passwords. 
To avoid this issue either create users intended to be managed by Vault outside of Ops Manager
or set the users to [unmanaged](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ops-manager/current/tutorial/manage-mongodb-users/#edit-one-mongodb-user-details).
