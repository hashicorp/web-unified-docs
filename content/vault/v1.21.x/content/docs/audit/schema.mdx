# Audit log entry schema

Vault logs audit entries as individual JSON objects separated by line breaks. Audit log entries include attributes that are common across all API endpoints and endpoint-specific request and response attributes.

Audit log entries represent API requests received by Vault and API response sent by Vault. You can match response entries to the corresponding request entry with the ID field of the `request` object (`.request.id`) included in both entries.

Attribute        | Type     | Description
---------------- | -------- | -----------
`auth`           | `object` | [`authentication`](#authentication-object) object describing the authenticated principal making the API call.
`error`          | `string` | Error string generated by the request or returned in the response. Omitted for successful transactions.
`forwarded_from` | `string` | Host and port of the performance standby node forwarding the request. Omitted for requests not forwarded.
`request`        | `object` | [`request`](#request-object) object describing the request details.
`response`       | `object` | [`response`](#response-object) object describing response details. Omitted for request entries.
`time`           | `string` | Date and time of the API request/response in ISO 8601 format.
`type`           | `string` | Type of the audit log entry. One of `request` or `response`.

## Authentication object

Vault omits irrelevant `authentication` object attributes from the audit entry. For example, `accessor` and `client_token` are irrelevant for unauthenticated requests and `metadata` is irrelevant if the authentication token lacks metadata.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `accessor` | `string` | Accessor of the Vault token that performed the request. This value is hashed by default; the example shows a *non-hashed* token accessor. Refer to [token accessors](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#token-accessors) for more information. |
| `client_token` | `string` | Vault token that performed the request, in hashed form. |
| `display_name` | `string` | Name associated with the Vault token that performed the request. This is a non-sensitive value that can help identify tokens. If a display name is not set, `"token"` will be shown. |
| `token_type` | `string` | Whether the Vault token is a `service`, `batch`, or `periodic` token. Refer to [token types](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#token-types). |
| `token_issue_time` | `string` | Date and time when the Vault token was issued, in ISO 8601 format. |
| `token_ttl` | `integer` | Validity period of the Vault token, in seconds and as of when the token was first issued, relative to `token_issue_time`. Note that this value is not updated when the token's lifetime is changed subsequent to initial issuance. |
| `metadata` | `object` | Metadata associated with the Vault token. |
| `num_uses` | `integer` | When the API request results in a token being issued, which token has a limited number of uses, the number of uses on that token. |
| `remaining_uses` | `integer` | If the Vault token has a limit on the number of uses, the number of uses remaining *prior to the current request*. |
| `entity_created` | `boolean` | Whether the request resulted in an entity being created, i.e. an authorized principal logs into Vault for the first time. Omitted when false. |
| `entity_id` | `string` | If the Vault token is associated with an entity, the ID of that entity. |
| `policies` | `list(string)` | List of the names of the ACL policies associated with either the Vault token or the corresponding entity. |
| `identity_policies` | `list(string)` | If the Vault token is associated with an entity, a list of the names of the ACL policies associated (directly or via group membership) with that entity. |
| `token_policies` | `list(string)` | A list of the names of the ACL policies associated directly with the Vault token. |
| `no_default_policy` | `boolean` | Whether the Vault token does **not** have Vault's "default" ACL policy associated with it. Omitted when false. |
| `external_namespace_ policies` | `object` | If the Vault token is associated with an entity, and that entity inherits ACL policies from a namespace other than the namespace in which the entity exists, a JSON object containing a boolean attribute `allowed` and `granting_policies`, a list of those inherited ACL policies. Refer to the JSON structure below for more information about `granting_policies`. |
| `policy_results` | `object` | JSON object containing a boolean attribute `allowed` and `granting_policies`, a list of ACL policies associated with either the Vault token or the corresponding entity that resulted in the request being allowed. Refer to the JSON structure below for more information about `granting_policies`. |

## Request object ((#request))

The following request object definition includes example data with simple types (`string`, `bool`, `int`) and used in other JSON examples that include a `<request>` object.

| `path` | `string` | API path that received the request. |
| `request_uri` | `string` | The original request path from the HTTP request, if it differs from `path` (e.g., when the Vault namespace is specified as an HTTP header). |
| `mount_accessor` | `string` | Unique identifier of the Vault mount (secret engine or authentication backend) that received the API request. |
