# HCP Terraform secrets engine

The HCP Terraform secrets engine for Vault generates
[HCP Terraform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)
API tokens dynamically for Organizations, Teams, and Users.

This page will show a quick start for this backend. For detailed documentation
on every path, use `vault path-help` after mounting the backend.

~> **Terraform Enterprise Support:** this secret engine supports both Terraform
Cloud ([app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/session)) as well as on-prem
Terraform Enterprise. Any version requirements will be documented alongside the
features that require them, if any.

## Quick start

Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their
functions. An operator or configuration management tool usually completes these steps.

1.  Enable the HCP Terraform secrets engine:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault secrets enable terraform
    Success! Enabled the terraform secrets engine at: terraform/
    ```

    By default, the secrets engine will mount at the name of the engine. To
    enable the secrets engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

2.  Configure Vault to connect and authenticate to HCP Terraform:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault write terraform/config \
        token=<user | team | org token>
    Success! Data written to: terraform/config
    ```

    Specify the `address` parameter when configuring Terraform Enterprise to 
    override the default `https://app.terraform.io`:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault write terraform/config \
        address="https://tfe.example.com" \
        token=<user | team | org token>
    Success! Data written to: terraform/config
    ```    

    See [HCP Terraform's documentation on API
    tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens)
    to determine the appropriate API token for use with the secret engine. 
    Choose a token that matches your intended scope. See 
    [Organization, legacy team, team, and user roles](#organization-legacy-team-team-and-user-roles) 
    section for additional considerations.

3.  Configure a role for an HCP Terraform Team

    Vault issues dynamic Team API tokens by mapping a role to an existing HCP Terraform 
    team. Vault manages these tokens’ lifecycle and automatically expires them according 
    to the role’s `ttl` and `max_ttl`.

    You will need to know the Team ID in order to generate Team API tokens for that team. You 
    can use the HCP Terraform Teams API to find the desired Team ID. To find the Team ID, use the 
    [HCP Terraform Teams API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/teams) 
    or navigate to the Teams section in the HCP Terraform UI. Similarly, to find a User ID, use the 
    [Account Details API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/account#show-the-current-user) 
    or check your user profile in the UI.

    ```shell-session
    $ vault write terraform/role/my-team-role \
        team_id=team-12345abcde \
        credential_type=team \
        description="CI/CD automation token" \
        ttl=300 \
        max_ttl=1800
    Success! Data written to: terraform/role/my-team-role
    ```

## Usage

After the secrets engine is configured, a Vault token with the proper permissions can generate 
short-lived Team API tokens.

Generate a new token by reading from the `/creds` endpoint with the role name:

```shell-session
$ vault read terraform/creds/my-team-role
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           terraform/creds/my-team-role/A_LEASE_ID_abc123
lease_duration     300s
lease_renewable    true
token              tftk.abcdef1234567890
token_id           at-456defghi789
description        CI/CD automation token(42)
expired_at         2025-11-08T21:30:00Z
```

## Organization, legacy team, team, and user roles

HCP Terraform supports four distinct types of API tokens; Organizations,
Teams, Legacy Team Tokens and Users. Each token type has distinct access levels 
and generation workflows. A given Vault role can manage any one of the 
supported types at a time, however there are important differences to be aware of.

~> **IMPORTANT:** When selecting an anchor credential for the Terraform Secrets 
Engine, choose a token whose scope matches your intended use case. For example, a 
user token can only manage that user’s own resources, while a team token can manage 
team-level resources or other teams’ tokens if the appropriate permissions are granted. 
Using a token that is too narrowly scoped may prevent Vault from issuing tokens for your 
intended workflows.

### Organization roles

Generating a new Organization API token by reading the credentials in
Vault or otherwise generating them on
[app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/session) will effectively revoke
**any** existing API token for that Organization.

Due to this behavior, Organization API tokens created by Vault will be
stored and returned on future requests, until the credentials get rotated. This
is to prevent unintentional revocation of tokens that are currently in-use.

Below is an example of creating a Vault role to manage an Organization
API token and rotating the token:

```shell-session
$ vault write terraform/role/testing \
    organization="${TF_ORGANIZATION}" \
    credential_type=organization
Success! Data written to: terraform/role/testing

$ vault write -f terraform/rotate-role/testing
Success! Data written to: terraform/rotate-role/testing
```

The API token is retrieved by reading the credentials for the role:

```shell-session
$ vault read terraform/creds/testing

Key             Value
---             -----
organization    hashicorp-vault-testing
role            testing
token           <example token>
token_id        at-fqvtdTQ5kQWcjUfG
```

### User roles

Traditionally, Vault secrets engines create dynamic users and credentials for those users.
At this time, the HCP Terraform API does not support creating dynamic users. Instead, the 
HCP Terraform secrets engine issues dynamic User API tokens by configuring a Vault role to 
manage an existing HCP Terraform user.

Vault manages the lifecycle of these tokens and automatically expires them based on the 
role’s configured `ttl` and `max_ttl`. Keep in mind that User API tokens are scoped to the 
individual user account — they cannot create or manage tokens for other users. If you need 
Vault to issue tokens that operate across teams or support automation workflows, use a team 
API token instead.

Below is an example of creating a Vault role to manage User API tokens:

```shell-session
$ vault write terraform/role/user-testing \
    user_id="${TF_USER_ID}"
Success! Data written to: terraform/role/user-testing
```

Retrieve the API token by reading the credentials for the role:

```shell-session
$ vault read terraform/creds/user-testing

Key             Value
---             -----
role            user-testing
token           <example token>
token_id        at-fqvtdTQ5kQWcjUfG
```

### Team roles

The HCP Terraform secret engine creates dynamic Team API tokens by 
configuring a Vault role to manage an existing HCP Terraform Team. 
The lifecycle of these tokens is managed by Vault and/or HCP Terraform.
Generally, Vault aims to manage tokens in external APIs with revoke actions
taken according to `ttl` and `max_ttl` settings. In addition to that behavior,
using the `max_ttl` Vault will set an `ExpiredAt` date in HCP Terraform 
which will ensure the token expires at the `max_ttl` time. This prevents 
Team tokens living past their `max_ttl` if Vault is unable to revoke the token.
Omitting the `max_ttl` value will default to Vault's system `max_ttl`.

In HCP Terraform, team tokens cannot have matching descriptions. In order to avoid
collisions, the secret engine generates a random string as a suffix to the description. 
It is highly recommended you set an additional description.

Below is an example of creating a Vault role to manage Team API tokens:

```shell-session
$ vault write terraform/role/team-testing \
    team_id="${TF_TEAM_ID}" \
    credential_type=team description="testing token" \
    ttl=200 \
    max_ttl=600
Success! Data written to: terraform/role/team-testing
```

The API token is retrieved by reading the credentials for the role:

```shell-session
$ vault read terraform/creds/team-testing

Key             Value
---             -----
lease_id           terraform/creds/team-testing/4oNxB4X0x77IrP51lBMJBiJi
lease_duration     3m20s
lease_renewable    true
description        testing token(74)
expired_at         2025-05-01T20:10:55Z
token              <example token>
token_id           at-GDMeMTvn3NhUernt
```

### Legacy team roles (Deprecated)

The HCP Terraform API limits Legacy Team roles to **one active
token at any given time**. Generating a new Legacy Team API token by
reading the credentials in Vault or otherwise generating them on
[app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/session) will effectively revoke **any**
existing API token for that Team.

Due to this behavior, Legacy Team API tokens created by Vault will be stored and
returned on future requests, until the credentials get rotated. This
is to prevent unintentional revocation of tokens that are currently in-use.

Below is an example of creating a Vault role to manage a Legacy Team API token and
rotating the token:

```shell-session
$ vault write terraform/role/legacy-team \
    team_id="${TF_TEAM_ID}" \
    credential_type=team_legacy
Success! Data written to: terraform/role/legacy-team

$ vault write -f terraform/rotate-role/legacy-team
Success! Data written to: terraform/rotate-role/legacy-team
```

The API token is retrieved by reading the credentials for the role:

```shell-session
$ vault read terraform/creds/legacy-team

Key             Value
---             -----
organization    n/a
role            legacy-team
team_id         team-<id>
token           <example token>
token_id        at-fqvtdTQ5kQWcjUfG
```
