# Configure LDAP for Resource access control facility (RACF)

A basic RACF configuration for LDAP automatically manages password phrases and
uses a Vault password policy to enforce password length and complexity.

<Tip title="Assumptions">

- You have [set up an `ldap` plugin](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/setup). 
- You have a Vault [password policy](/vault/docs/concepts/password-policies)
  defined for your RACF schema.

</Tip>
