# Why use TLS?

You can enhance the overall security posture of your Vault cluster when you
secure communications with TLS to ensure that data transmitted between Vault
nodes and clients remains confidential and tamper-proof.

@include 'ld-images/deploy/secure-vault-tls.mdx'

Use mutual TLS with your Vault cluster deployments to protect sensitive data and
prevent unauthorized access with enhanced compliance, governance, auditing
capabilities, and incident response.

## TLS benefits

- **Improved data protection**.
  TLS prevents unauthorized access or communication with the Vault cluster to
  ensure data availability based on your security policies. TLS also protects
  sensitive data in transit to prevent interception or tampering.

- **Strong identity verification**.
  Vault cluster nodes and clients verify identities from TLS certificates before
  communicating to enable trusted operations and prevent impersonation.

- **Improved compliance and governance**.
  Implementing mutual TLS in your Vault clusters aligns your deployments with
  industry best practices and regulatory requirements like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and
  others.

- **Reduce risk of data leaks**.
  When you operate Vault clusters with mutual TLS enabled, you minimize the risk
  of data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- **Improved incident response**.
  Mutual TLS helps to limit the exposure or damage from unauthorized access to
  sensitive data stored in Vault, which makes incident response more
  straightforward.
