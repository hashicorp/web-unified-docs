## Install the Vault Helm chart configured to address an external Vault

The Vault Helm chart can deploy the Vault Agent Injector service configured
to target an external Vault. The injector service enables the authentication and
secret retrieval for the applications, by adding Vault Agent containers as they
are written to the pod automatically it includes specific annotations.

Use the below `values.yaml` to set up an external vault server or
cluster.

```yaml
injector:
  externalVaultAddr: 'http://external-vault:8200'
```

To set this value via the Helm CLI:

```bash
helm install vault hashicorp/vault \
  --set injector.externalVaultAddr='http://external-vault:8200'
```

This deploys an [Vault Agent Injector](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/deploy/kubernetes/injector) that points to an external Vault server or cluster. The
external Vault server or cluster must be reachable from the Kubernetes cluster.

The token for the `vault` service account is not created automatically, and you must create it explicitly.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: vault-token-g955r
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/service-account.name: vault
   type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
   EOF
   ```
