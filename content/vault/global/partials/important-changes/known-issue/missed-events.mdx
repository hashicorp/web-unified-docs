Users may miss events when multiple clients subscribe to with the same namespace
and event type filters on the same performance standby node in a cluster.

A single client disconnecting effectively unsubscribes the remaining clients who
no longer receive events.

#### Recommendation

If you have multiple event subscribers with the same namespace and event type
filters you have two options:

1. Spread the subscriptions out among the nodes of the Vault cluster.
1. Only subscribe to events on the active node of the cluster.
