### Renamed timestamp fields for client count activity export ((#client-count-export))

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.21.x -->

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.21.0+          | All

<!-- END: Vault:=v1.21.x -->

Vault counts a client tokens the first time an authenticated call uses it, which
could precede the start of the billing period.

Previously, the Activity Export endpoint response included a `timestamp`
parameter that referred to the creation time and date for the client token
rather than the time and date when Vault counted the token.

To clarify the data returned, the endpoint now returns two timestamp paramters.

- **`client_first_usage_time`** - (new) indicates the first use/count of the
  token.
- **`token_creation_time`** - (replaces `timestamp`) indicates the creation
  timestamp of the token.


#### Recommendation

Update any references to the old `timestamp` attribute to use
`token_creation_time`.
