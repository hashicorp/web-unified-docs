### Renamed timestamp fields for client count activity export ((#client-count-export))

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.21.x -->

Vault counts a client the first time that client makes an authenticated API
during the billing period.

Previously, the Activity Export endpoint response included a `timestamp`
field that reflected the creation time and date for the client token, which
could precede the start of the billing period, rather than the time and date
of the first authenticated API call.

To clarify the data returned, the endpoint now returns two timestamp paramters:

- **`client_first_usage_time`** - (new) indicates the client first made an
  authenticated API call during the billing period.
- **`token_creation_time`** - (replaces `timestamp`) indicates the creation
  timestamp of the token.


#### Recommendation

Review your use of the `timestamp` field and:

1. Consider if the context makes `client_first_usage_time` a more appropriate
   timestamp.
1. Update any remaining references to `timestamp` to use `token_creation_time`.
