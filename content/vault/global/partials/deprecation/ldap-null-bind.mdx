### LDAP authentication deny_null_bind parameter ((#ldap-null-bind))

| Announced | Expected end of support | Expected removal |

The `deny_null_bind` parameter in the LDAP authentication method is deprecated.

Vault now denies all login attempts with an empty password, regardless of how
you set the `deny_null_bind` parameter.

As a result, for deployments where `deny_null_bind` is set to `false`, Vault now
rejects login attempts that previously succeeded with an empty password.

If you currently have `deny_null_bind` set to `true`, you do not need to take
action now. But you will need to remove the parameter when you upgrade to the
next major release.
