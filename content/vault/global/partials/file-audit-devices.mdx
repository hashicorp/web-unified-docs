### CVE-2025-6000: File audit devices cannot use executable file permissions ((#cve-2025-6000))

| Change       | Affected version                     | Vault edition
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.1+, 1.19.7+, 1.18.12+, 1.16.23+ | All

File audit devices require explicit configuration for prefixing and cannot use
executable file permissions.  You must set `allow_audit_log_prefixing` to `true`
in your server configuration to enable `file` audit devices with the `prefix`
option. Additionally, `file` audit devices cannot use file modes with executable
permissions (e.g., 0777, 0755).

#### Recommendation

If you use `file` audit devices:

1. Add `allow_audit_log_prefixing = true` to your Vault server configuration if
   you want to use the `prefix` option.
1. Use non-executable file modes (e.g., 0644, 0666) for log files.
