# SPIFFE secrets engine

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

The `spiffe` secrets engine allows for minting SPIFFE JWT-SVIDS using a
template that can interpolate identity information about the requesting entity.
These JWTs are OIDC-compatible and so can also be used in the same way
as JWT tokens minted using the identity engine.

## Configuration

Each SPIFFE backend instance has a single trust domain. Roles are used to
define templates that determine the claims in the minted JWTs.

## Integrate with SPIRE

The SPIFFE secrets engine has an endpoint `trust_bundle/web` that serves
the trust bundle. This can be used by other systems that implement SPIFFE
federation, e.g. [SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/spire/) or another Vault cluster
running the [SPIFFE auth method.](../../auth/spiffe), in order to fetch
the public keys needed to validate JWTs minted by this secret engine.

## Integrate with OIDC

The SPIFFE secrets engine has endpoints `.well-known/openid-configuration`
and `.well-known/keys` that allow OIDC providers to validate JWTs minted
by this secret engine.

## SPIFFE secrets engine API

The SPIFFE secrets engine has a full HTTP API. Refer to the
[SPIFFE secrets engine documentation](/vault/api-docs/spiffe) for more details.
