# Service discovery and service mesh in Nomad

Service discovery and service mesh are two related but distinct
concepts in microservices architectures, especially when using
orchestration platforms like Nomad. 

Service discovery solves the core problem how to find and reach the current
healthy instances of a service. A service mesh goes beyond service discovery to
provide a more robust solution in a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling
service-to-service communication in a secure, observable, and reliable way.

While both service discovery and service mesh address connectivity in Nomad,
they differ in scope, complexity, and features. The following table lists key
differences between service discovery and service mesh in relation to Nomad.


| Apsect               | Service discovery    | Service mesh    |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| **Primary focus**        | Locating services with a registry                       | Managing inter-service communication - traffic, security, observability          |
| **Implementation**       | Centralized registry for registration and queries       | Sidecar proxies plus a control plane                                             |
| **Features**             | Basic: Registration, health checks                      | Advanced: Load balancing, mTLS, circuit braking, tracing, policy enforcement     |
| **Complexity and scale** | Suitable for small systems, lightweight setup           | Ideal for complex systems; adds overhead from proxies but reduces app-level code |
| **Security**             | Limited; relies on network-level controls               | Built-in zero trust: identity-based auth and encryption                          |
| **Nomad integration**    | Native for basic service discovery; Consul for enhanced | Requires Consul service mesh for full capabilities and hybrid environments       |
