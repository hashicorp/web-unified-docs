# Overview of targets

[Targets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/targets) are Boundary resources that represent a networked service that end-users with appropriate permissions can connect to.

A target allows Boundary users to define an endpoint with a default port and a protocol to establish a session. Targets require a network address, which can be directly defined on the target for quick access or one-off connections, or using [host sets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/host-sets) for deployments at scale. Hosts within host sets are considered the same from an access management perspective. Boundary will choose one [host](/boundary/docs/domain-model/hosts) in the host set to connect to at random.

To learn more about creating hosts and host sets, refer to the [Host management in Boundary](/boundary/docs/hosts) page.

## Target types

In Boundary the following target types are available:

- TCP
- SSH <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>
- RDP <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>

For HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise users, SSH and RDP targets enable enterprise features like [session recording](/boundary/docs/session-recording). You must use these target types if you want to [record and audit session activity](/boundary/docs/concepts/auditing) using Boundary.

To learn how to configure a worker for session recording, refer to the [Configure workers for session recording](/boundary/docs/session-recording/configuration/configure-worker-storage) page.

## TCP targets

TCP targets use the TCP protocol to establish sessions. They represent generic targets in that use a network address and a port to connect on, and use the TCP protocol to handle network traffic.

A TCP target can be a database, SSH server, HTTP endpoint, Kubernetes cluster, or a Windows server. TCP targets are not aware of the details for any server you are connecting to. TCP targets are only aware of the address and port you define for sessions to connect with.

Different [connection workflows](/boundary/docs/targets/connections) exist for end users, such as the [Boundary Desktop Client](/boundary/tutorials/get-started-hcp/hcp-getting-started-desktop-app), the `boundary connect` command, and transparent sessions. Boundary also includes [connect helpers](/boundary/docs/targets/connections/connect-helpers) for the CLI to make connecting to TCP targets easier.

To learn how to create and manage TCP targets, refer to the [Create a TCP target](/boundary/docs/targets/tcp) page.

## SSH targets <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>

[SSH targets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/targets#ssh-target-attributes) are an HCP Boundary and Boundary Enterprise feature. SSH targets enable session recording and auditing by using a worker to intercept the SSH data stream and upload the recording into a storage backend. Configuring session recording is not required to use SSH target types.

To learn how to create and manage SSH targets, refer to the [Create an SSH target](/boundary/docs/targets/ssh) page.

## RDP targets <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>

[RDP targets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/targets#rdp-target-attributes) are an HCP Boundary and Boundary Enterprise feature. RDP targets enable session recording and auditing by using a worker to intercept the RDP data stream and upload the recording into a storage backend. Configuring session recording is not required to use RDP target types.

To learn how to create and manage RDP targets, refer to the [Create an RDP target](/boundary/docs/targets/rdp) page.
