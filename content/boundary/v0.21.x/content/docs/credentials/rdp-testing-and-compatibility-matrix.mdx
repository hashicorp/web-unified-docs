# RDP credential injection compatibility

**Key takeaways for the RDP credential injection beta:**

- **Credential source:** The initial beta only supports static credentials from Boundary's built-in **static credential store** or Vault's Key Value store.
- **Supported authentication:** Only **Kerberos** and **NTLMv2** are supported.
- **Unsupported authentication:** Microsoft Entra ID, passwordless methods (Windows Hello, FIDO2), and Smart Cards are **not** supported.
- **Transparent sessions:** RDP transparent sessions on Windows clients require a custom port configuration due to a conflict with the default port `3389`. Refer to [Using transparent sessions with RDP on Windows](#using-transparent-sessions-with-rdp-on-windows) for two possible workarounds.
- **Initial connection:** Users must manually accept a self-signed certificate on their first connection to a target.
- **Important configuration note:** If you use the Windows RDP client and set the `connection limit` to `1` for RDP targets it will cause all RDP connections to fail. You can leave the connection limit unset or configure a limit of 2 or higher to account for the multiple connections used by the RDP client.

## Configuration requirements

Refer to the following sections for specific configuration requirements for the RDP credential injection beta.

### Certificate handling

Boundary generates self-signed certificates for each RDP target. When users first connect to a target, they must manually accept the certificate. This is a one-time action per target for most clients, though behavior varies:

- **Windows clients** remember certificates across sessions.
- **macOS clients** require accepting certificates per alias or endpoint.
- **Custom listen addresses** generate certificate mismatch warnings.

### Connection limits

The Windows Remote Desktop Connection application consumes multiple connections when initiating a session.

If you set the connection limit to `1` for RDP targets it will cause all RDP connections using this client to fail. You can leave the connection limit unset or configure a limit of 2 or higher to account for the multiple connections used by the RDP client.

### Client behavior

Different RDP clients exhibit unique behaviors:

**Windows Remote Desktop Connection:**

- Requires manual certificate acceptance per endpoint.

**macOS Windows App:**

- Requires manual certificate acceptance per endpoint.

## Compatibility status

## Quick troubleshooting and FAQ

**Q: Why am I getting a certificate warning when I connect?**

A: This is expected behavior. Boundary generates a self-signed certificate for each RDP target. You must accept this certificate on your first connection.

**Q: My connection is failing immediately. What should I check first?**

A: Check the `connection limit` on your target. It cannot be set to `1`. Leave it unset, or set it to 2 or higher.

**Q: Why can't I connect to my RDP transparent session on Windows by just using its name?**

A: Modern Windows versions block local applications from using the default RDP port (3389). You must use a workaround, such as connecting to a custom port or using a pre-configured `.rdp` file. Refer to [Using transparent sessions with RDP on Windows](#using-transparent-sessions-with-rdp-on-windows).

**Q: Does this work with servers that require Entra ID login?**

A: No. At this time, only servers using traditional Kerberos or NTLMv2 authentication are supported.

RDP credential injection is supported
