# ibmkms KMS

The IBM KMS configures Boundary to use IBM Key Protect for key management.

## `ibmkp` example

This example shows an IBM KMS stanza in the Boundary configuration file:

````hcl
kms "ibmkp" {
    purpose     = "root"
    api_key     = "8uEy9TUDVtUHuUGXpsMlpTb4rp8B_ZEfjU28ujik_nyw"
    instance_id = "0647c737-906d-4f4e-8a68-2c187e11b29b"
    key_id      = "key-protect-key1"
    endpoint    = "https://cloud.ibm.com"
    key_name    = "global_worker-auth"
}
````

## `ibmkp` parameters

The IBM KMS uses the following parameters in the `kms` stanza of the Boundary configuration file:

- `purpose` - States the purpose of the KMS, supported values are `worker-auth`, `worker-auth-storage`, `root`, `previous-root`, `recovery`, `bsr`, or `config`.

  To enable session recording, you must configure the `bsr` value for the `purpose`.

- `api_key` `(string: "")` - The API key used to authenticate to IBM Cloud services.
You can also specify this value using the `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `instance_id` `(string: <required>)` - The ID for the IBM Key Protect instance.
You can also specify this value using the `IBMCLOUD_KP_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.
- `key_id` `(string: <required>)` - The IBM Key Protect key to use for encryption and decryption.
You can also specify this value using the `IBMCLOUD_KP_KEY_ID` environment variable.
- `endpoint` `(string: "")` - The KMS API endpoint to use for making IBM KMS requests.
You can also specify this value using the `IBM_KP_ENDPOINT` environment variable.
- `key_name` - The unique name for this key.
It is used to identify the key when you perform a root key migration.

## Authentication

You must provide authentication-related values either as environment variables or as configuration parameters.

The IBM Key Protect authentication values include:

- `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY`
- `IBMCLOUD_KP_INSTANCE_ID`
- `IBMCLOUD_KP_KEY_ID`
- `IBMCLOUD_KP_ENDPOINT`
