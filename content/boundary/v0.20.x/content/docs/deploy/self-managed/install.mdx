# Install Boundary

You can install Boundary using two methods:

1. Using a package manager, the official package 
provides a systemd service unit, and a local `boundary` user account under which
the service runs.

2. Manual install using pre-built Boundary packages are available from the [HashiCorp Linux
Repository](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-hashicorp-linux-repository).

Steps for both options are provided below.

<Note>

You must complete the following steps for each Boundary controller and worker
node that you want to deploy. The binary operates as either a worker or
controller, depending on the configuration that you generate for the
Boundary binary.

</Note>


## Install using a package manager


The steps vary by Linux distribution.

Select your distribution of Boundary, and complete the steps to install the

## Manual install using downloaded binaries

1. From the [Boundary install page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/install), retrieve the appropriate binary download.

2. Unzip the binary into the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

3. Set environment variable. 

```
export NAME=boundary
```

Set TYPE to `controller` or `worker` depending on whether you intend to configure as a Boundary controller or a worker
Example:
```
export TYPE=worker
```

4. Create a *systemd* unit file with the contents below:

```
sudo cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/${NAME}-${TYPE}.service
[Unit]
Description=${NAME} ${TYPE}
 
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/${NAME} server -config /etc/${NAME}-${TYPE}.hcl
User=boundary
Group=boundary
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
Capabilities=CAP_IPC_LOCK+ep
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYSLOG CAP_IPC_LOCK
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

5. Create and set permissions for boundary as a user

```
sudo adduser --system --group boundary || true
sudo chown boundary:boundary /etc/${NAME}-${TYPE}.hcl
sudo chown boundary:boundary /usr/local/bin/boundary
sudo chown boundary:boundary /home
```

You should install the binary on the controller and worker instances you configure to run in your Boundary environments.

## Next steps

After you install the binary, you should:

1. [Configure controllers](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/configure-controllers)
1. [Deploy workers](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/deploy-workers)
1. [Initialize Boundary](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/initialize)
1. [Install the Boundary Clients](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/install-clients)
