# Terraform Enterprise Licenses

Terraform Enterprise requires a valid license before you can install it. Your HashiCorp account team provides a license after you purchase the product or engage in a trial. This license is required to install a Replicated deployment of Terraform Enterprise and _differs_ from the license Terraform Enterprise [Flexible Deployment Options](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/license) requires. 

Please contact your account team for more information regarding acquiring either license.
