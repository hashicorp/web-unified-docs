# Database connection overview

This topic provides overview information about configuring Terraform Enterprise to connect to an
external PostgreSQL database. 

You only need to connect to an external database when operating
Terraform Enterprise in `active-active` or `external` mode. These modes instruct
Terraform Enterprise to store and retrieve data in an externally-managed
database. If you prefer to allow Terraform Enterprise to manage the database,
configure Terraform Enterprise to run in `disk` mode. Refer to
[Configure operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode)
for additional information.
-> **Connecting to HA PostgreSQL is in beta.**  Do not deploy beta features in production environments. Provision a dedicated test environment before connecting Terraform Enterprise to an HA PostgreSQL cluster. If you have questions or feedback, contact your HashiCorp account representative.
## Workflows

Terraform Enterprise stores stateful application data, such as, workspace
settings, organization settings, run information, and user information in a
PostgreSQL database. 

You can deploy an external database or a cluster of highly-available database nodes and configure Terraform Enterprise to connect to it. 
Refer to the following topics for instructions:

- [Connect to an external PostgreSQL database](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/connect-database/postgres): Describes how to connecto to a single-node database instance.
- [Connect to a highly-available PostgreSQL cluster](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/connect-database/postgres-cluster): Describes how to connecto to a cluster of database instances. This functionality is in beta.
