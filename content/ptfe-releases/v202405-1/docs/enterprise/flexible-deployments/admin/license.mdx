### Check logs

Automatic license utilization reporting will start sending data within roughly 24 hours. [Check the product logs](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/observability/logs) for records that the data sent successfully.

```json
{
  "@level": "debug",
  "@message": "export finished successfully",
  "@module": "tfe-licensing.licensingexporter",
  "@timestamp": "2023-05-10T17:48:06.656979Z"
}
```

If your installation is air-gapped or your network does not allow the correct egress, logs show the following error:

```json
{
  "@level": "error",
  "@message": "error exporting snapshot",
  "@module": "tfe-licensing.census",
  "@timestamp": "2023-05-11T01:50:51.662155Z",
  "err": "export failed with error POST https://reporting.hashicorp.services giving up after 5 attempt(s): Post \"https://reporting.hashicorp.services\": dial tcp 35.166.5.222:443: i/o timeout"
}
```

In this case, reconfigure your network to allow egress and check back in roughly 24 hours.

## Opt out of license utilization reporting

If your installation is air-gapped or you want to manually collect and report on the same license utilization metrics, you can opt-out of automated reporting.

Manually reporting these metrics can be time-consuming. Opting out of automated reporting does not mean that you also opt out from sending license utilization metrics. Customers who opt out of automated reporting will still be required to manually collect and send license utilization metrics to HashiCorp.

If you are considering opting out because you’re worried about the data, we strongly recommend that you review the [example payloads](#example-payloads) before opting out. If you have concerns with any of the automatically-reported data please bring them to your account manager.

Add the following environment variable to your deployment configuration `TFE_LICENSE_REPORTING_OPT_OUT=TRUE`.

Restart the application and check your product logs roughly 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system isn’t trying to send reports.

## Enable product usage reporting

Terraform Enterprise reports product usage data to HashiCorp in order to guide you through data insights and improve product value, experience, and quality. You can enable and disable product usage reporting separately from license utilization reporting. Reporting is enabled by default.

## Allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443

Make sure that your network allows egress to `https://api.replicated.com`, as described in the [network requirements documentation](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/network#egress).

Make sure that your network also allows HTTPS egress on port 443 from `https://reporting.hashicorp.services` by allow-listing the following IP addresses:

- `100.20.70.12`
- `35.166.5.22`
- `23.95.85.111`
- `44.215.244.1`

### Check logs

Automatic license utilization reporting will start sending data within roughly 24 hours. [Check the product logs](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/observability/logs) for records that the data sent successfully.

Terraform Enterprise logs report an error when your installation is air-gapped or when your network does not allow the correct egress.

## Opt out of product usage reporting

If your installation is air-gapped or you do not want to report product utilization data to HashiCorp, you can opt out of reporting.

1. Add the following environment variable to your deployment configuration `TFE_USAGE_REPORTING_OPT_OUT=TRUE`.
1. Restart your system.
1. Check your product logs roughly 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system does not send reports.
