# Migrating to Flexible Deployment Options

Flexible Deployment Options supports migrations between like versions of the application. We do not support combining an application upgrade and migrating from Replicated to Flexible Deployment Options. Upgrade your current installation of Terraform Enterprise to the latest version before proceeding with your Flexible Deployment Options migration.

We support the following migration paths from Replicated releases of Terraform Enterprise to Flexible Deployment Options.

- Docker:

  - Refer to the [Migrate Terraform Enterprise from Replicated to Docker Engine](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/video-migrate-terraform-enterprise-from-replicated-to-docker-engine) video for a comprehensive walkthrough that describes how to migrate to a Docker runtime.
  - [Migrating using mounted disk operational mode to Docker runtime](#mounted-disk-to-docker)
  - [Migrating using external services operational mode to Docker runtime](#external-services-to-docker)

- Kubernetes

  - [Migrating using mounted disk to Cloud-managed Kubernetes](#mounted-disk-to-cloud-managed-kubernetes)
  - [Migrating using external services or Active/Active to Cloud-managed Kubernetes](#external-services-or-active-active-to-cloud-managed-kubernetes)

- Podman
    - The procedure for [migrating to Podman](#migrate-to-podman) is the same for mounted disk and external services operational modes.

## Overview

Use the same procedure to migrate from a Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise to another supported runtime:

1. Back up your current Terraform Enterprise data tier (such as Postgres and Object Storage).
1. Upgrade your current Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) installation to a FDO-compatible Terraform Enterprise version - `v202309-1` or later. Migrations from Replicated to Flexible Deployment Options are only supported between like versions.
1. Prepare your new installation of Terraform Enterprise.
1. Migrate your data tier to your new installation.

## Prerequisites

### Back up data tier

1. We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting maintenance or upgrade operations. The backup method will depend on your existing installation.

   - For mounted disk installations, refer to [Backup a Mounted Disk Deployment](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#backup-a-mounted-disk-deployment) in the Terraform Enterprise backup tutorial for recommended patterns.
   - For external services or active active installations, refer to [Object Store](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#object-store) and [Database](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#database) in the Terraform Enterprise backup tutorial for recommended patterns.

   In both cases, we recommend backing up the environment variables of the Terraform Enterprise Docker container so that you can refer to them when configuring your target runtime.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker exec terraform-enterprise env > env.txt
   ```

### Upgrade existing Terraform Enterprise installation to a Flexible Deployment Options compatible version

1. [Upgrade the existing Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades) (Replicated) installation to a version compatible for migration to Flexible Deployment Options. The minimum version is [v202309-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202309-1).
1. Validate that Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) upgraded successfully by doing the following:
   1. Validate the release version.
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app inspect
      ```
   1. Check that Replicated has started.
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app status
      ```
   1. Check that the docker containers are up.
      ```shell-session
      $ sudo docker ps
      ```
   1. Do a health check.
      ```shell-session
      $ tfe-admin health-check
      ```
   1. Do a `terraform plan` and a `terraform apply`.

## Mounted disk to Docker

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

If at any point you need to revert your settings, see [the rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration#mounted-disk-rollback-steps).

### Migration steps

#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. See the backup data guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for a detailed
guide on how to move forward with the backup process.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Terraform Enterprise to Flexible Deployment Options compatible version

The existing Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated) should run a Flexible Deployment Options compatible version. See the upgrade guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section
for a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade the Terraform Enterprise for the migration.

#### Step 3: Verify Docker Engine version

Docker should already be installed for you because Replicated is installed on this host. You may still need to install Docker Compose if you have not already.
See the [Docker Engine Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/requirements/docker_engine) for more information.

If Docker Engine cannot be upgraded or installed in a supported docker configuration then Flexible Deployment Options should be installed and migrated to on a different host.

#### Step 4: Generate Docker Compose configuration

Docker Compose configurations generated on releases older than v202410-1 may contain formatting errors. Terraform Enterprise may format passwords or secrets that contain special characters incorrectly if your configuration contains double quotation marks instead of single quotation marks. 

To address this issue, you can manually replace double quotation marks with single quotation marks around secrets in your compose configuration.

We fixed this issue in v202410-1. Refer to the [v202410-1 release notes](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202410-1) for additional information. 

To convert your existing configuration into a Docker Compose format on your current Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated), follow these steps:
1. Create a `/etc/terraform-enterprise` directory.
1. Generate the Docker Compose configuration and save it to `/etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml` using the following command:
```shell-session
sudo docker exec terraform-enterprise tfectl app config --format docker > /etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml
```
Your saved output should resemble the configuration file in [our mounted disk example](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install#mounted-disk).

Terraform Enterprise may generate a configuration that contains errors.  Manually review the configuration to verify that it is complete and accurate.

#### Step 5: Prepare the host and install

To make migration smoother and faster, we recommend using the same host as your current Replicated instance.

-> **Note**: If you want to use a separate host for your new docker-based Terraform Enterprise, we can provide alternative steps. [Reach out to support for assistance](/terraform/enterprise/support).

1. Review the configuration file from the previous step. Update any values as needed before moving on to the next step. Pay special attention to placeholder values enclosed in `<>`, such as `image` and `TFE_LICENSE`, and replace them with your actual values.

   Alternatively, you can use the [mounted disk example](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install#mounted-disk) as a starting point and adjust it to fit your environment.

   Note the use of bind mounts in the volumes section. You can source many of your required values from the Replicated application configuration backup you created earlier. For a comprehensive list of configuration settings for Flexible Deployment Options, refer to the [Configuration Reference](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/configuration).

1. Log in to the Terraform Enterprise container image registry.

   ```shell-session
   $ cat <PATH_TO_HASHICORP_LICENSE_FILE> |  docker login --username terraform images.releases.hashicorp.com --password-stdin
   ```

1. Pull the Terraform Enterprise image from the registry.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker pull images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
   ```

1. Create a new `systemd` service for Terraform Enterprise by creating a `/etc/systemd/system/terraform-enterprise.service` file with [the contents on the Docker Installation guide](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install). Update this systemd unit file if any of the following are true:

   - The name or the path of the `docker-compose.yml` has changed.
   - The path to the Docker binary and the command to invoke `docker compose` is different because Docker Engine 1.13.1 is installed.

#### Step 6: Stop Replicated and migrate

Next, you can stop Replicated and migrate your Terraform Enterprise installation to Docker.

1. SSH into your Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) instance.
1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```
1. Back up your data. If you have already backed up your data proceed forward. If not, or if you want another backup for safe keeping, do the following.
   - Retrieve your mounted disk path.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .disk_path.Value }}' | tr -d '\r'
   ```
   - We will refer to this path as the `${DISK_PATH}` going forward. Next, archive your mounted disk data.
   ```shell-session
   $ tar -zcvf data.tar.gz -C ${DISK_PATH} aux postgres
   ```
   - Copy your `data.tar.gz` archive to a safe place.
1. Start (and enable on start up) the Docker Compose based Terraform Enterprise.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Check the status of your service with `systemctl status terraform-enterprise`, or use `docker ps` to find your container's name then run `docker logs [name]`. You can also run `curl https://[hostname]/_health_check` to check the health check endpoint. Terraform Enterprise should now be running using Docker Compose, so your Replicated services can be shut down and disabled.

1. Shut down Replicated.

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```

1. Next, stop and remove the unnecessary Replicated containers.
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-premkit
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-statsd
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
   ```

-> **Note**: some of the `docker stop` commands may return “Container not found” errors because not every Replicated install has every container.

#### Step 7: Validate migration success

Finally, test that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, you can use those instead of doing the following steps.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Mounted Disk rollback steps

In the unlikely event you encounter issues and need to roll back, you can revert back to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) using the following commands.

1. Stop and disable Terraform Enterprise (Docker).
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Start and enable Replicated.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```
1. Start Terraform Enterprise (Replicated)
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## External services to Docker

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

When Terraform Enterprise is operating in `active-active` mode, you can scale directly up to your target number of nodes after the migration is complete. You do not need to scale to one node before scaling to all nodes.

If at any point you need to revert your settings, see [the rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration#external-services-rollback-steps).

### Migration steps

#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. See the backup data guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for a detailed
guide on how to move forward with the backup process.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Terraform Enterprise to Flexible Deployment Options compatible section

The existing Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated) should run a Flexible Deployment Options compatible version. The minimum version is [v202309-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202309-1). See the upgrade guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section
for a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade the Terraform Enterprise for the migration.

#### Step 3: Verify Docker engine version

Docker should already be installed for you because Replicated is installed on this host. You may still need to install Docker Compose if you have not already.
See the [Docker Engine Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/requirements/docker_engine) for more information.

If Docker Engine cannot be upgraded or installed in a supported docker configuration then Flexible Deployment Options should be installed and migrated to on a different host.

#### Step 4: Generate Docker Compose configuration

Docker Compose configurations generated on releases older than v202410-1 may contain formatting errors. Terraform Enterprise may format passwords or secrets that contain special characters incorrectly if your configuration contains double quotation marks instead of single quotation marks. 

To address this issue, you can manually replace double quotation marks with single quotation marks around secrets in your compose configuration.

We fixed this issue in v202410-1. Refer to the [v202410-1 release notes](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202410-1) for additional information. 

To convert your existing configuration into a Docker Compose format on your current Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated), follow these steps:
1. Create a directory at `/etc/terraform-enterprise`.

1. Generate the Docker Compose configuration and save it to `/etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml` using the following command:
   ```shell-session
   sudo docker exec terraform-enterprise tfectl app config --format docker > /etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml
   ```
   Your saved output should resemble the configuration file in [our external services example](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install#external-services).

Terraform Enterprise may generate a configuration that contains errors.  Manually review the configuration to verify that it is complete and accurate.

#### Step 5: Prepare the host and install

To make migration smoother and faster, we recommend using the same host as your current Replicated instance.

-> **Note**: If you want to use a separate host for your new docker-based Terraform Enterprise, we can provide alternative steps. [Reach out to support for assistance](/terraform/enterprise/support).

1. Complete the instructions for creating and applying TLS certificates described in [step two of the Docker installation set up documentation](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install#2-set-up).
1. Review the configuration file from previous step. Update any values as needed before moving on to the next step. Pay special attention to placeholder values enclosed in `<>`, such as `image` and `TFE_LICENSE`, and replace them with your actual values.

   Alternatively, you can use the [external services installation instructions for Flexible Deployment Options](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install#external-services) as a starting point and adjust it to fit your environment.

   Update, verify, and remove any unsuitable configuration variables that don't match the reality of your current Terraform Enterprise deployment. For a comprehensive list of available configuration settings, refer to the [Configuration Reference](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/configuration).

   To quickly identify many of the required configuration values, inspect the existing Terraform Enterprise application using the `replicatedctl app-config export` command.

1. To pull a `terraform-enterprise` Flexible Deployment Options image, first log into the registry, and then use the `docker` command to pull the image version.

   ```shell-session
   $ cat <PATH_TO_HASHICORP_LICENSE_FILE> | docker login --username terraform images.releases.hashicorp.com --password-stdin
   ```

   When prompted for a password, use the contents of your HashiCorp license file as your password.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker pull images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
   ```

1. Optionally create a new systemd service for Terraform Enterprise. Refer to [step two of the Docker installation set up documentation](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install#systemd).

   -> **Note**: If you want to use a separate host for your new Docker-based Terraform Enterprise deployment, [contact HashiCorp support](/terraform/enterprise/support) for assistance.

#### Step 6: Stop Replicated and migrate

Next, you can stop Replicated and migrate your Terraform Enterprise installation to Docker.

1. SSH into your Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) instance.
1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```
1. Start (and enable on start up) the Docker Compose based Terraform Enterprise.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Check the status of your service with `systemctl status terraform-enterprise`, or use `docker ps` to find your container's name then run `docker logs [name]`. You can also run `curl https://[hostname]/_health_check` to check the health check endpoint. Terraform Enterprise should now be running using Docker Compose, so your Replicated services can be shut down and disabled.

1. Shut down Replicated.

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```

1. Next, stop and remove the unnecessary Replicated containers.
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-premkit
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-statsd
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
   ```

-> **Note**: Some of the `docker stop` commands may return “Container not found” errors because not every Replicated install has every container.

#### Step 7: Validate migration success

Finally, test that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, f those instead of doing the following steps.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### External Services rollback steps

In the unlikely event you encounter issues and need to roll back, you can revert back to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) using the following commands.

1. Stop and disable Terraform Enterprise (Docker).
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Start and enable Replicated.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```
1. Start Terraform Enterprise (Replicated)
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## Mounted disk to Cloud-managed Kubernetes

In order to meet the [Terraform Enterprise Kubernetes Installation Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/requirements), you must provide an external Postgres server, external object storage, and external Redis storage.

If you currently use the [mounted disk operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/operational-modes#operational-modes) for Terraform Enterprise on Replicated, you do not meet the above requirements.
You must first [migrate to external services mode](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/administration/infrastructure/mounted-to-external-migration), and then follow the external services to Kubernetes migration guide as well as deploy an external Redis server.
At a high level, this process involves:

1. [Backing up your data](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#backup-a-mounted-disk-deployment).
1. [Restoring your data to external services](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-recovery).
1. Testing that the external services migration succeeded.
1. Deploying external redis.
1. Follow the guide for [External Services to Kubernetes migration](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration#external-services-or-active-active-to-cloud-managed-kubernetes).

Contact your HashiCorp account representative or HashiCorp support if you have additional questions.

## External services or Active/Active to Cloud-managed Kubernetes

Redis is a _required service_ for running Terraform Enterprise in Kubernetes. If you currently use the [external services operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/operational-modes#operational-modes), you need to deploy an external Redis server.

If using the Active/Active operational mode, you have all the required service dependencies for migrating to Kubernetes. Refer to [Terraform Enterprise Kubernetes Installation Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/requirements) for more details on the requirements for running Terraform Enterprise in Kubernetes.

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

When Terraform Enterprise is operating in `active-active` mode, you can scale directly up to your target number of nodes after the migration is complete. You do not need to scale to one node before scaling to all nodes.

If at any point you need to revert your settings, see [the rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration#kubernetes-rollback-steps).

### Migration steps

#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. See the backup data guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for a detailed
guide on how to move forward with the backup process.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Terraform Enterprise to Flexible Deployment Options compatible section

The existing Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated) should run a Flexible Deployment Options compatible version. See the upgrade guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section
for a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade the Terraform Enterprise for the migration.

#### Step 1: Prepare the custom Helm Values file for Terraform Enterprise

1. On Terraform Enterprise (Replicated), view existing configuration:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app-config export
   ```

1. Create a custom [Helm Values file](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) e.g `overrides.yaml` to override the [default values](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/blob/main/values.yaml) in the [Terraform Enterprise Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/tree/main).

1. On the `env.secrets` and `env.variables` sections of the [overrides values file](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/blob/main/values.yaml), use the external services credentials from the Replicated installation for the Kubernetes installation. Specifically the following:
   1. The `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_TYPE` and `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_*` variables should specify the object storage type and the container or bucket credentials from your Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_DATABASE_*` variables should specify database credentials from the Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_REDIS_*` values on the Helm chart should specify the same credentials from the external Redis in your Replicated installation.
   1. If there is an external vault, the `TFE_VAULT_*` values on the Helm chart should specify the same credentials from the external Vault in your Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` value should match the Replicated installation value. You can get this from your Replicated instance via SSH by running the following command:
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .enc_password.Value }}'
      ```
      Refer to the [Replicated to Flexible Deployment Options configurations mapping](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/configuration#replicated-to-flexible-deployment-options-configuration-mapping) for more information on how the Replicated configuration maps to the variables and secrets on Terraform Enterprise Helm chart.

-> **Note**: Use the [Kubernetes requirements page](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/requirements) as a detailed reference
of cloud-specific override values for the Helm deployment.

#### Step 2: Migrate to Kubernetes

1. Stop your Replicated installation by executing the following command:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```

1. Wait for the application to stop:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app status
   ```

1. [Install Terraform Enterprise on Kubernetes using Helm](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/install).

#### Step 3: Validate migration success

Finally, test that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, you can use those instead of doing the following steps. You should
be able to log in to your new Terraform Enterprise installation with the credentials previously used for your Replicated installation.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Kubernetes rollback steps

In the unlikely event you encounter issues that cannot be worked around, you can rollback to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated).

1. If it is possible to `exec` into the pods, run the `node drain` command to stop Terraform Enterprise from executing further instructions.

   ```shell-session
   $ tfectl node drain --all
   ```

1. Uninstall the deployment.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm uninstall terraform-enterprise
   ```

1. Restart Terraform Enterprise on Replicated using the same external services.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## Migrate to Podman

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

Complete the following steps to migrate from Replicated to Podman.

The minimum Terraform Enterprise version necessary for Podman is [v202404-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202404-1).

When Terraform Enterprise is operating in `active-active` mode, you can scale directly up to your target number of nodes after the migration is complete. You do not need to scale to one node before scaling to all nodes.

#### Step 1: Prepare the host

We recommend deploying Terraform Enterprise to the same host as your current Replicated instance.

[Contact HashiCorp support](/terraform/enterprise/support) for assistance migrating your Terraform Enterprise installation to a separate host.

1. We recommend reusing your Replicated certificate to minimize the upgrade's effect on your other stack components.

   Create a directory with the following:

   - TLS certificate (`cert.pem`)
   - TLS private key (`key.pem`)
   - CA certificates bundle (`bundle.pem`)

   If you do not have a CA certificates bundle, place your TLS certificate (`cert.pem`) inside `bundle.pem` instead.
   Add your certificates to a folder on your host.

   If you cannot access your certificate, key, or bundle file, you can retrieve them from the Replicated Terraform Enterprise container. Run the following command to list the certificate paths in the container:

   ```sh
   docker exec terraform-enterprise tfectl app config --unredacted | jq '{cert: .tls.cert_file, key: .tls.key_file, bundle: .tls.ca_bundle_file}'
   ```

   Depending on your setup, the file paths may differ from the following example output:

   ```sh
   {
   "cert": "/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/cert.pem",
   "key": "/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/key.pem",
   "bundle": "/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/bundle.pem"
   }
   ```

   You can then copy the files from the container into the host.

   ```sh
   docker cp terraform-enterprise:/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/cert.pem <PATH_TO_CERTS_ON_HOST>/cert.pem
   docker cp terraform-enterprise:/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/key.pem <PATH_TO_CERTS_ON_HOST>/key.pem
   docker cp terraform-enterprise:/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/bundle.pem <PATH_TO_CERTS_ON_HOST>/bundle.pem
   ```

1. Next, backup your Replicated configuration.
   Your Replicated configuration contains necessary information, such as the `<TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD>` as `enc_password` and the `<MOUNTED_DISK_PATH>` as `disk_path`.

   ```
   replicatedctl app-config export > replicated-app-config.backup.json
   ```

1. Create a yaml file based on the template for your current operational mode: 
     - [Mounted Disk operational mode Kubernetes YAML example](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/install#mounted-disk).
     - [External operational mode Kubernetes YAML example](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/install#external-services).
     - [Active/Active operational mode Kubernetes YAML example](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/install#active-active).

   Replace the values enclosed in `<>` with your installation's values. For example, set `TFE_HOSTNAME` to the DNS hostname you use to access Terraform Enterprise.

#### Step 2: Stop Terraform Enterprise and remove Replicated

Replicated runs using `docker`, while Podman uses `podman-docker`. Installing Podman removes docker, which is why we recommend backing up your data before stopping your Terraform Enterprise instance. Ensure you have [backed up your data](#step-1-backup-your-data-tier-3) and [Replicated configuration](#step-3-prepare-the-host) before proceeding.

1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding.

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```

1. Shut down Replicated.

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```

1. Next, stop and clean up your unnecessary Replicated containers.
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-premkit
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-statsd
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
   ```

#### Step 3: Install Podman

Verify that you have met the [requirements for deploying to Podman](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/requirements) before installing Terraform Enterprise on Podman.
Follow the [Podman installation guide](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/install).

#### Step 4: Download and install image

1.  Log into the Terraform Enterprise container image registry using `terraform`
    as the username and your HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise license as the password:

    ```shell-session
    $ echo "<HASHICORP_LICENSE>" |  podman login --username terraform images.releases.hashicorp.com --password-stdin
    ```

1.  Pull the Terraform Enterprise image from the registry.

    ```shell-session
    $ podman pull images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
    ```

#### Step 5: Start a Terraform pod

1.  Create a Terraform Enterprise pod by running the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman play kube <path_to_YAML_file>
    ```

1.  In a separate terminal session, you can monitor the logs by running the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman logs -f <container_name>
    ```

1.  Monitor the health of the application until it starts reporting healthy with the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman exec <container_name> tfe-health-check-status
    ```

#### Step 6: Validate migration success

Complete the following steps to verify that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works as expected. Alternatively, you can execute your existing suite of release acceptance tests.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI to test several subsystems. This step ensures that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and that the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from version control to test that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation policies enabled. This step ensures that run tasks and cost estimation function as expected.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool to verify that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Mounted Disk rollback steps

Complete the following steps to revert to a Replicated deployment.

1. Stop Terraform Enterprise on Podman.

   ```shell-session
   $ podman play kube <path_to_YAML_file> --down
   ```

2. Remove Podman.

   ```shell-session
   $ dnf module remove -y container-tools
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ dnf remove -y podman-docker
   ```

3. Install Terraform Enterprise on Replicated.

   If available, you can reuse the instance initialization script to reinstall Terraform Enterprise on Replicated. Otherwise, refer to the [Replicated installation guide](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/interactive/installer#installation).

## Troubleshooting

Please read the Flexible Deployment Options monitoring documentation to ensure you have uninterrupted visibility into the health of the application:

- [Startup Checks](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/startup-checks)

- [Logs](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/observability/logs)

- [Metrics](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/observability/metrics)

### Common Issues

Below are a list of common migration issues and symptoms of those issues.

#### Self signed certificates CA not in CA bundle

##### Symptoms:

- Plans Fail
- See errors in `/var/log/terraform-enterprise/task-worker.log` and `/var/log/terraform-enterprise/atlas.log` (particularly when making calls to Archivist) where the certificate is from an unknown issuer

##### Fix:

- Bring the additional certificates from the full chain certificate into the CA Bundle
- Note: Replicated did some of this automatically, for Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options you may need to manually concatenate the certificates from the full chain certificate into the CA Bundle for the instance to talk to itself.

#### Required CA not in CA bundle

##### Symptom:

- Setting up VCS fails with unknown certificate issuer error

##### Fix:

- Include the CA in the CA Bundle

#### Internal calls to instance or AWS Metadata Endpoint unnecessarily proxied

##### Symptom:

- Plans May fail, Logs may fail to load (but not always)
- The proxy directs traffic unexpectedly

##### Fix:

- When deployed to Replicated, Terraform builds much of the default `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` address list, but you are responsible for managing the list when deploying to the other supported runtimes. In addition to manually adding the entries from your Replicated `Additional No Proxy List` configuration, add the following entries to the `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` address list:
  - `localhost`
  - `127.0.0.1`
  - `169.254.169.254`
  - FQDN of instance
  - Rest of `no_proxy` list
