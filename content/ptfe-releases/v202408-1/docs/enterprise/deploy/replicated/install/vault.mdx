# External Vault Requirements for Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise automatically creates an internally-managed Vault server
that stores its data in the PostgreSQL Database. We strongly recommend that
organizations use this internally-managed Vault server. However, some
organizations have specific requirements around data encryption and auditing.
Those organizations can configure Terraform Enterprise to use an external Vault
server rather than the internally-managed Vault server.

We only recommend using external Vault when you have experience managing Vault
in production. This approach requires that you assume full responsibility for
the Vault server, including sealing, unsealing, replication, etc.

!> **Warning:** Do not configure multiple Terraform Enterprise instances to use the same namespace on an external Vault server unless they are part of an [Active/Active](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/install/automated/active-active) installation. Doing so will result in data loss.


### External Vault Configuration

~> **Important:** You must configure External Vault during initial installation. After installation, you can only change the configuration using the [backup and restore API](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/backup-restore).

Run the following commands to configure your external Vault server for use with
Terraform Enterprise.
