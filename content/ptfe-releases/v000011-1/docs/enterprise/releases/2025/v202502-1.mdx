# Terraform Enterprise v202502-1 (808)

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:c0b547bcbc29a561936dc6b088253eeb728329da0f3e4b6db5a374b59710c24f`

## Known Issues

1. [Updated February 27, 2025] Terraform Enterprise does not support usernames provided with the `REDIS_USER ` variable to authenticate with an external Redis instance.
1. [Updated March 13, 2025] The `ruby-saml` gem prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 includes the vulnerabilites described
  in [CVE-2025-25291](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-25291),
  [CVE-2025-25292](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-25292), and
  [CVE-2025-25293](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-25293). A HashiCorp security bulletin will be
  published with additional details. This issue is fixed in v202502-2.

## Breaking Changes

1. Terraform Enterprise no longer supports Postgres 12.

## Deprecations

1. Terraform Enterprise now supports new deployment options and will end support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option.
The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in March 2025 (extended from November 2024). Effective December 2024,
only pre-existing workflows and capabilities will be tested for continued quality on Replicated releases. New features and product
improvements will not be validated on Replicated releases. HashiCorp Support will support this release until April 1, 2026, but
bug and security fixes backports will not be available after March.
2. As part of improving support for HA Postgres installations, the following configuration options are deprecated and will be removed in the May 2025 release: `TFE_DATABASE_RECONNECT_ENABLED`, `TFE_DATABASE_RECONNECT_MAX_RETRIES`, `TFE_DATABASE_RECONNECT_INTERVAL`, and `TFE_DATABASE_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT`.

## Highlights
1. This release introduces project-owned variable sets. Users with project **Write**, **Maintain**, **Admin**, or custom variable set permissions can create and manage variable sets within a project without requiring organization-level permissions.
1. You can now set auto-destroy settings at a project level, letting you [automatically destroy workspace infrastructure in a project](/terraform/enterprise/projects/manage#automatically-destroy-inactive-workspaces) after a period of inactivity.

## Features

1. You can add a secondary hostname in Terraform Enterprise and specify whether to use the `primary` or `secondary` hostname for OIDC integration.
1. Module authors can now [deprecate module versions](/terraform/enterprise/registry/manage-module-versions) in the private registry. Deprecating a module version in your organizationâ€™s private registry adds warnings to the module's registry page.
1. You can now select **Enable Debugging mode** when enqueuing a run for quick access to trace level Terraform logging.

## Improvements

1. User input is now obfuscated while typing sensitive variables and notification tokens, enhancing security, particularly during screen sharing.
1. Terraform Enterprise will now automatically attempt to unseal the internal Vault server if it unexpectedly enters a sealed state. This change has no impact on Terraform Enterprise running with an external Vault server.
1. No-code workspaces now inform users of a pending user action, such as a policy override, and direct users to the run page for further action.

## Bug Fixes

1. Fixes an issue with cost estimation where unexpected AWS RDS instance types could cause the cost estimate to fail.
1. Fixes a permissions bug where teams with organization permission **View all workspaces** could not view workspace outputs.
1. Fixes variable set limitation issue and significantly improves performance for the workspaces-variable page.
1. Improves queries for fetching registry modules and associations to fix performance issue in *List Modules for Organization* API.
