# Terraform Enterprise v202409-2 (789)

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:0be28e68ff83dcafe379aa955ce9065a3303f0fa4107e8758d9cf852fbaf98e1`

## Changes Since v202409-1
1. The `tfectl node drain` now properly finishes the node draining process. 


## Known Issues
1. [Updated September 30, 2024] Some deployments are experiencing memory growth issues on v202401-1 or higher, sometimes resulting in out of memory errors that require a restart to resolve. This issue is currently being investigated. It is strongly recommended that you test in a non-production environment before deploying v202401-1 or higher in production, and monitor memory for unexpected growth. This message will be updated when a fix is available in a published release.
2. [Updated November 25, 2024] Terraform Enterprise does not currently support using a username provided via `REDIS_USER` for authenticating with an external Redis instance.
To use authentication with Redis, configure Redis to require only a password for the default user by updating your Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`) as follows, replacing `<your password>` accordingly:
```redis.conf
requirepass <your password>
```
In the Terraform Enterprise environment, set only the `REDIS_PASSWORD` variable with the corresponding value.

## Deprecations

1. [Updated January 21, 2025] Terraform Enterprise now supports new deployment options and will end support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option.
   The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in March 2025 (extended from November 2024). Effective December 2024,
   only pre-existing workflows and capabilities will be tested for continued quality on Replicated releases. New features and product
   improvements will not be validated on Replicated releases. HashiCorp Support will support this release until April 1, 2026, but
   bug and security fixes backports will not be available after March.
1. The `terraform-build-worker-plan-timeout` and `terraform-build-worker-apply-timeout` attributes in the admin organization and general settings API have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Terraform Enterprise. Use the new `plan-timeout` and `apply-timeout` attributes instead.
1. Terraform Enterprise now supports new deployment options and will end support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option. The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in November 2024. HashiCorp will support this release until April 1, 2026.

  To ensure you continue to receive the latest features and fixes, including security updates, please plan to migrate to a new deployment option by **November 2024**. For more information, check out [Flexible Deployment Options](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/) or contact your HashiCorp account representative.
1. The variables API endpoint, `/vars`, is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. All existing integrations with this API should transition to the [workspace variables API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspace-variables) `/workspaces/:workspace_id/vars`.
1. PostgreSQL v12 will reach end of life on November 12 2024 and will no longer be supported in Terraform Enterprise after that date. Please refer to [PostgreSQL Requirements for Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/data-storage/postgres-requirements) for a complete list of supported versions.


## Improvements

1. A run task's associated workspaces are now paginated on the page where you edit run tasks, reducing load times for run tasks associated with many workspaces.
1. Users with VCS workspaces that contain README files may see improved response times during workspace updates.
1. New `tfectl` commands have been added to retrive the application version, `tfectl app version`, and the last completed database migrtion, `tfectl db last-applied-migration`.


## Bug Fixes

1. You can now delete organizations that contain on-demand policy evaluations.
1. Previously single resource instance created with terraform `count` statement or `for-each`  in HCP could not be replaced because the state-parser did not parse the index_key. Single resource instances can now be replaced.
1. Workspace Notifications have been updated to work with [workflows in Microsoft Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/).


## Security

1. The `ruby-saml` gem has been updated to v1.17.0 to address [CVE-2024-45409](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jw9c-mfg7-9rx2). Analysis of Terraform Enterprise specific exposure to this issue is currently in progress and a HashiCorp security bulletin will be published if determined appropriate.
1. Container and binary updates address reported vulnerabilities (CVEs) in underlying base images, packages, and dependencies.
