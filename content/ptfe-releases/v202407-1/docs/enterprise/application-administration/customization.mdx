## Support

### Email Address

The support email address is used in system emails, error pages, and all other situations the user would be prompted to contact support. It defaults to <support@hashicorp.com>. If you'd like  users of your instance to reach out to a specific person or team when they have issues, it can be changed to a local email address.

### Error Instructions
