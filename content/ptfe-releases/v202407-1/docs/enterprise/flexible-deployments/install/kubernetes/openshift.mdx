# Operate Terraform Enterprise on Red Hat OpenShift

Operating Terraform Enterprise on Red Hat OpenShift is similar to running Terraform Enterprise in other Kubernetes environments. 

You must set the `openshift.enabled` Helm chart value to `true` in your overrides values file so that Terraform Enterprise launches with a security configuration that meets OpenShift's restricted security constraints. Refer to the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html) for additional information about the security constraints. 

When set to `true`, the `openshift.enabled` value also sets the [`TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_KUBERNETES_OPEN_SHIFT_ENABLED`](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/configuration#tfe_run_pipeline_kubernetes_open_shift_enabled) configuration variable to `true`.


## Security context constraints

The `terraform-enterprise` Helm chart launches Terraform Enterprise with the
following security context configuration settings:

```yaml
securityContext:
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  runAsNonRoot: true
```

This configuration is required to comply with the restricted security context constraints in OpenShift environments.
These constraints prioritize the security goal of preventing a process from escalating and escaping the container.

Terraform Enterprise uses Linux capabilities to generate independent container IDs so that each service inside the Terraform Enterprise container runs under a unique user ID. This behavior, however, is not allowed under the default `securityContext` configuration. Setting the `openshift.enabled` value to `true` turns off varied user IDs, which enables Terraform Enterprise to start each service as the OpenShift-assigned container entry user ID.

## Extend or fork the OpenShift `terraform-enterprise` helm chart

The [Terraform Enterprise Helm Chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm) is intended to meet the needs of the majority of our users. Many OpenShift primitives, such as routing, are absent in the `terraform-enterprise` Helm chart. You can fork our Helm chart and adapt it to your organizationâ€™s requirements. Alternatively, you can use the `terraform-enterprise` Helm chart as a [sub-chart](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/), thus relegating OpenShift primitives to the parent chart to be deployed around the `terraform-enterprise` chart contents.

If you contact HashiCorp support, include your custom Helm chart alongside your support bundle to ensure support has all the information they need.
