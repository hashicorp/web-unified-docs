# Terraform Cloud agents on Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Cloud agents allow Terraform Enterprise to communicate with isolated,
private, or on-premises infrastructure. By deploying lightweight agents within a
specific network segment, you can establish a simple connection between your
environment and Terraform Enterprise which allows for provisioning operations and
management.

Terraform Cloud agents on Terraform Enterprise behave very similarly to [Terraform Cloud agents on HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents),
with a few exceptions listed below.

-> **Note:** Terraform Cloud agents on Terraform Enterprise are available in Terraform Enterprise releases `v202109-1`
and later.

## Differences Between Agents on HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise

* **No restriction on Agent Count**: Terraform Enterprise does not
  place a limitation on the number of Agents that can be registered per organization.

* **Hostname Registration**: Terraform Cloud agents registering with a Terraform Enterprise instance
  must define the Terraform Enterprise hostname via the `-address` CLI flag or `TFC_ADDRESS` environment
  variable when running `tfc-agent`. By default, `tfc-agent` will attempt to connect to
  HCP Terraform, so this value must be explicitly defined when registering with a
  Terraform Enterprise instance.

* **Custom Bundle Support**: Terraform Cloud agents on Terraform Enterprise support
  [custom Terraform bundles](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/main/tools/terraform-bundle).
  Custom bundles are created and defined within the Terraform Enterprise application; Agents will
  download the custom bundle based on the Terraform version information. See
  [using a custom Terraform bundle](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016992613-Using-custom-and-community-providers-in-Terraform-Cloud-and-Enterprise)
  for more detail on custom bundles in Terraform Enterprise.

* **Network Access Requirements**: Terraform Cloud agents on Terraform Enterprise must be able to
  communicate with the Terraform Enterprise instance via HTTPS. Additionally, the agent must also be
  able to communicate with any services required by the Terraform code it is executing.
  This includes the Terraform releases distribution service, [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com),
  as well as the [Terraform provider registry](https://registry.terraform.io). Agents
  executing in a workspace that leverage a Terraform version that provides a custom
  Terraform bundle with pre-existing provider binaries do not need access to these resources.

* **Agent Version Compatibility**: Terraform Enterprise places restrictions on what versions of Terraform Cloud agents can be registered. This is to prevent an incompatible agent from registering with a Terraform Enterprise instance and attempting to execute a Terraform operation in an undefined way. Compatible versions of Terraform Cloud agents on Terraform Enterprise will vary based on the specific Terraform Enterprise release sequence; any changes to compatible Terraform Cloud agents versions will be noted in the [Terraform Enterprise release notes](/terraform/enterprise/releases).
