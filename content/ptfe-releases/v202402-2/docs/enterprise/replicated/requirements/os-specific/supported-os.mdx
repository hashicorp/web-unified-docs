## SELinux

Terraform Enterprise supports SELinux running in enforcing mode when certain requirements are met. These requirements vary depending on the type of Terraform Enterprise installation.

For External Services installations, you must install the latest version of the `container-selinux` package.

For Mounted Disk installations, you must:

- Install the latest version of the `container-selinux` package.
- Add the `container_file_t` type to the SELinux context for the mounted disk path and its subdirectories. The commands below update the mounted disk path `/opt/tfe` and its subdirectories to use the correct SELinux context.

  ```
  semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t "/opt/tfe(/.*)?"
  restorecon -R /opt/tfe
  ```
