# Environment Variables

These are all environment variables that you can use to configure the behavior of CDKTF.

## DEBUG

If set to a not-empty value you will get more logs for the provider generation process.

## CDKTF_DISABLE_PLUGIN_CACHE_ENV

If set to a not-empty value, the [plugin cache](/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache) will be disabled. Otherwise `cdktf` will set the `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` and create the required directory in `~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache` if it's not already present.

## CDKTF_HOME

If set overwrites where CDKTF stores cache and configuration files, defaults to `~/.cdktf`.

## CHECKPOINT_DISABLE

If set to a not-empty value, no [telemetry](/cdktf/telemetry) will be send.

## CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL

Can be set to one of the following values:

- `all`
- `debug`
- `verbose`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`
- `fatal`

It controls how much debug information gets printed to the console.

## CDKTF_DISABLE_LOGGING

If set to `"false"` the logs will be written to local log files.

## TERRAFORM_BINARY_NAME

If set you can overwrite the Terraform binary to use. If it's not set the terraform binary in path will be used.

## TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN

If set this token will be used to authenticate against Terraform Cloud, it needs to be set to a valid [Terraform Cloud API token](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens).

## http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY

If set this proxy will be used for all HTTP requests.

## DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK

If set to a non-empty value, no version check will be performed. If it is not set we will verify your installed library version matches the CLI version and warn if they do not match.
