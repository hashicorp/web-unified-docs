# Command: test

The `terraform test` command is currently serving as part of
[the module integration testing experiment](/language/modules/testing-experiment).

It's not ready for routine use, but if you'd be interested in trying the
prototype functionality then we'd love to hear your feedback. See the
experiment details page linked above for more information.
