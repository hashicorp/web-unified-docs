# Variables and Outputs

The Terraform language includes a few kinds of blocks for requesting or
publishing named values.

- [Input Variables](/terraform/language/block/variable) serve as parameters for
  a Terraform module, so users can customize behavior without editing the source.

- [Output Values](/terraform/language/block/output) are like return values for a
  Terraform module.

- [The `locals` block](/terraform/language/block/locals) is a convenience feature for
  assigning a short name to an expression.
