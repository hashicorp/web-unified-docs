# Manage values in modules

Make your Terraform modules flexible, composable, and reusable by defining input variable values, local values, and output values.

## Background

Terraform modules communicate with each other through the interface of inputs and outputs. Variables add parameters to your module, letting users input values at runtime. Outputs expose data from a module, letting you export information about your infrastructure. Locals let you define and reuse expressions within a module.

Defining clear interfaces for your modules creates boundaries between them, letting you compose infrastructure from reusable components while keeping each module's implementation independent.

## Define variables to input module arguments

Variables define the input interface of your module by specifying the values your module accepts as arguments.

For example, the following `variable` block defines an input variable named `instance_type`, letting a module consumer specify an EC2 instance type for `web` at runtime:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,8" hideClipboard>

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type        = string
  description = "EC2 instance type for the web server"
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


To learn more about defining variables, assigning values to them, and managing variables in HCP Terraform, refer to [Use variables to input module arguments](/terraform/language/values/variables). To learn more about the `variable` block and its arguments, refer to the [`variable` block reference](/terraform/language/block/variable).

## Define locals to reuse expressions

Locals define temporary values scoped to your module, letting you name and reuse expressions in your configuration. For example, the following `locals` block defines a local value for the name of an application:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,8">

```hcl
locals {
  app_name = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # ...
  tags = {
    Name = local.app_name
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example2" {
  # ...
  tags = {
    Name = local.app_name
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can reference locals in other parts of your configuration to avoid retyping an expression multiple times.

To learn more about when to use local values, refer to [Use locals to reuse expressions](/terraform/language/values/locals). To learn more about the `locals` block and its arguments, refer to the [`locals` block reference](/terraform/language/block/locals).

## Define outputs to expose module data

Outputs expose data from a module, making module values available in the Terraform CLI, HCP Terraform, and other parts of your configuration.

In the following example, the `instance_ip` output exports the private IP address of the `web` EC2 instance:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1-4" hideClipboard>

```hcl
output "instance_ip" {
  description = "Private IP address of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.web.private_ip
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # â€¦
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To learn more about exposing data from modules and accessing those values, refer to [Use outputs to expose module data](/terraform/language/values/outputs). To learn more about the `output` block and its arguments, refer to the [`output` block reference](/terraform/language/block/output).
