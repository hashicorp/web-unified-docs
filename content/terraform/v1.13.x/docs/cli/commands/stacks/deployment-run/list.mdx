# `terraform stacks deployment-run list` reference

Use the `terraform stacks deployment-run list` command to list the deployment runs of a deployment group.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks <global-stacks-flags> deployment-run list <options>
```

## Description

List the deployment runs of a deployment group. This command will display the ids of each deployment run, as their timestamps.

Either `-deployment-group-id` must be provided, or `-deployment-group-name` in conjunction with `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` must be provided. If name arguments are used, the deployment group associated with the latest configuration version for the specified stack will be targeted.

## Options

- `-organization-name`: The name of the organization to target.
  - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
  - String.
  - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_ORGANIZATION_NAME` if provided.

- `-project-name`: The name of the project to target.
  - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
  - String.
  - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_PROJECT_NAME` if provided.

- `-stack-name`: The name of the stack to target.
  - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
  - String.
  - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_STACK_NAME` if provided.

- `-deployment-group-name`: The name of the deployment group to list the deployment runs of within the latest configuration of the stack specified in `-stack-name`.
  - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
  - String.
  - Requires the arguments `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` to be provided.

- `-deployment-group-id`: The id of the deployment group to list the deployment runs of.
  - Optional (but required if not using `-deployment-group-name`).
  - String.
  - Has precedence over `-deployment-group-name` if both are provided.

- `-json`: Output results in JSON format instead of the default human-readable text format.
  - Optional.
  - Boolean.

## Examples

The following command lists deployment runs using deployment group ID:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-run list -deployment-group-id dg-abc123
```

The following command lists deployment runs using deployment group name:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-run list -organization-name=my-org -project-name my-project -stack-name my-stack -deployment-group-name my-deployment-group
```
