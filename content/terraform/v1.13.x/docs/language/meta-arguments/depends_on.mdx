# `depends_on` reference

Use the `depends_on` meta-argument to handle hidden resource or module dependencies that Terraform cannot automatically infer. You only need to explicitly specify a dependency when a resource or module relies on another resource's behavior but does not access any of that resource's data in its arguments. 

## Usage

You can use the `depends_on` meta-argument in `module` blocks and in all `resource` blocks, regardless of resource type. 

It requires a list of references to other resources or child modules in the same calling module. This list cannot include arbitrary expressions because the `depends_on` value must be known before Terraform knows resource relationships and thus before it can safely evaluate expressions. 

In the following example, the `depends_on` argument instructs Terraform to handle a hidden dependency on the `aws_iam_instance_profile.example` resource.

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  name = "example"

  # assume_role_policy is omitted for brevity in this example. Refer to the
  # documentation for aws_iam_role for a complete example.
  assume_role_policy = "..."
}

resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "example" {
  # Because this expression refers to the role, Terraform automatically
  # infers that the role must be created first.
  role = aws_iam_role.example.name
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "example" {
  name   = "example"
  role   = aws_iam_role.example.name
  policy = jsonencode({
    "Statement" = [{
      # This policy allows software running on the EC2 instance to
      # access the S3 API.
      "Action" = "s3:*",
      "Effect" = "Allow",
    }],
  })
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Terraform can infer from this that the instance profile must
  # be created before the EC2 instance.
  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.example

  # However, if software running in this EC2 instance needs access
  # to the S3 API in order to boot properly, there is also a 
  # dependency on the aws_iam_role_policy that Terraform cannot
  # automatically infer, so you must declare it explicitly:
  depends_on = [
    aws_iam_role_policy.example
  ]
}
```

## Processing and planning consequences

The `depends_on` meta-argument instructs Terraform to complete all actions on the dependency object, including read operations, before performing operations on the object declaring the dependency. When the dependency object is an entire module, `depends_on` affects the order in which Terraform processes all of the resources and data sources associated with that module. Refer to the documentation on [specifying resource dependencies](/terraform/language/resources/configure#specify-resource-dependencies) and [data resource dependencies](/terraform/language/data-sources#dependencies) for more details.

You should only use `depends_on` as a last resort because it can cause Terraform to create more conservative plans that replace more resources than necessary. For example, Terraform may treat more values as unknown `"(known after apply)"` because it is uncertain what changes will occur on the upstream object. This is especially likely when you use `depends_on` for modules.

Instead of `depends_on`, we recommend using [expression references](/terraform/language/expressions/references) to imply dependencies when possible. Expression references let Terraform understand which value the reference derives from and avoid planning changes if that particular value hasnâ€™t changed, even if other parts of the upstream object have planned changes.

## Supported constructs

You can use `depends_on` in the following Terraform configuration blocks:

- [`check` blocks](/terraform/language/block/resource)
- [`data` blocks](/terraform/language/block/data)
- [`ephemeral` blocks](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- [`module` blocks](/terraform/language/block/module)
- [`output` blocks](/terraform/language/block/output)
- [`resource` blocks](/terraform/language/block/resource)

## Example use cases 

The following use cases describe common patterns for the `depends_on` argument.

### Specify a dependency during validation

Add a `depends_on` argument to a `data` block nested in a [`check` block](/terraform/language/block/check) validation when the data source depends on another resource but doesn't reference the resource directly.  

`check` blocks validate infrastructure outside of the typical resource lifecycle. You can nest a `data` block inside a `check` block to fetch information that you can reference in an `assert` block. By adding a `depends_on` argument to the `data` block nested in a `check` block requires, Terraform retrieves the necessary data before running the validation.

For example, if you define a `check` that verifies that a website API returns `200`, that check fails the first time Terraform runs your configuration because your website's infrastructure does not exist yet. You can set the `depends_on` argument to a resource, such as the load balancer, to ensure Terraform only runs the `check` once the website is up. When running an operation, Terraform evaluates the `check`, warns `known after apply` until that crucial piece of your website is ready, and continues the operation.

However, this strategy only works when the `data` block does not directly reference the resource specified in the `depends_on` argument. Otherwise, anytime that resource changes, the `check` block warns `known after apply` until Terraform updates that resource, making your check potentially noisy and ineffective. 

In the following example, Terraform waits to run the check until it creates the `aws_db_instance.main` database. Terraform prints `known after apply`, instead of printing false warnings, until it finishes creating the database:

```hcl
check "database_connection" {
 data "postgresql_database" "app_db" {
   name       = "application"
   depends_on = [aws_db_instance.main]
 }

 assert {
   condition     = data.postgresql_database.app_db.allow_connections
   error_message = "Database is not accepting connections"
 }
}
```

### Create a database service that other services depend on 

In the following example, Terraform must launch the `aws_db_instance` service first so that `aws_instance` can connect to it:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd-gp3/ubuntu-noble-24.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "api" {
  allocated_storage   = 10
  db_name             = "api_db"
  engine              = "postgres"
  engine_version      = "17.4"
  instance_class      = "db.t3.micro"
  username            = "foo"
  password            = "foobarbaz"
  skip_final_snapshot = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "api" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_db_instance.api]
}
```

### Specify a dependency on the parent module

In the following example, Terraform only creates the EC2 instance module after creating the S3 bucket resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket-12345"
}

module "ec2_instance" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "6.0.2"
  name    = "example-instance"
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```

### Specify a dependency when outputting values

In the following example, `instance_ip_addr` adds an explicit dependency on the security group rule to ensure that Terraform creates the security group before exposing the IP address:

```hcl
output "instance_ip_addr" {
  value       = aws_instance.server.private_ip
  description = "The private IP address of the main server instance."

  depends_on = [
    # Services are unreachable unless the security group rule is created
    # before exposing this IP address.
    aws_security_group_rule.local_access,
  ]
}
```

The `output` block typically does not require explicit dependencies so we recommend that when you add an explicit dependency, include a comment to explain why it's necessary.
