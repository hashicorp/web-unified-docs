# Meta-arguments

Meta-arguments are a class of arguments built into the Terraform configuration language that control how Terraform creates your infrastructure. You can use meta-arguments in any type of resource, including resources created with `data` blocks. You can also use most meta-arguments in `module` blocks.

The provider developer determines resource-specific arguments, but all resources support meta-arguments that let you manage resources' infrastructure lifecycle, including destruction behavior, preventing destruction, and establishing dependencies between resources. Terraform provides the following meta-arguments.

<Note>

Terraform `v1.14.x (beta)` adds the `action_trigger` meta-argument, which lets you trigger actions that extend Terraform CRUD operations. Refer to the [Invoke an action](/terraform/language/v1.14.x/invoke-actions) beta documentation for more information.

</Note>

## `depends_on`

The `depends_on` meta-argument establishes dependencies between resources that do not directly reference one another. Use the `depends_on` argument to explicitly set the order in which Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`depends_on` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for details.

## `count`

By default, Terraform manages one infrastructure object for each `resource` block. Terraform also creates single instances of a module per `module` block. You can use the `count` argument in `resource` and `module` blocks to create and manage multiple instances of each without writing a separate block for each instance. Refer to the [`count` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details.

## `for_each`

By default, Terraform configures one infrastructure object for each `resource`, `module`, and `ephemeral` block. You can add the `for_each` block to your `resource`, `data`, `module`, and `ephemeral` blocks to create and manage several similar objects, such as a fixed pool of compute instances, without writing a separate block for each instance. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details.

## `provider`

By default, Terraform determines the local name of the provider from the first word in the resource type and uses that provider's default configuration to create the resource. You can add multiple `provider` blocks to your configuration and use the `provider` argument to a resource definition to specify which provider it should use. Refer to the [`provider` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/provider) for details.

## `providers`

By default, child modules inherit the default provider configurations of their parent module. You can specify an alternate provider configuration in the `module` block using the `providers` argument. The `providers` argument instructs Terraform to use the reference provider configuration to create the module resources. Refer to the [`providers` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/providers) for details.

## `lifecycle`

The `lifecycle` block accepts a rule that customizes how Terraform performs the lifecycle stages for each resource. Support for each `lifecycle` rule varies across Terraform configuration blocks. Refer to the [`lifecycle` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) for details.
