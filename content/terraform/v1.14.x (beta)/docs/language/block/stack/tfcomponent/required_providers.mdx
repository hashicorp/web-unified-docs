# `required_providers` block reference

Terraform relies on plugins called providers to interact with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs. Use the `required_providers` block in your component configuration to declare which providers your Stack requires.

If you are declaring a `required_providers` block in a traditional Terraform configuration file, ending in `.tf`, refer to the Terraform configuration [`terraform` block reference](/terraform/language/block/terraform#required_providers) instead.


## Background

In component configurations, you must define the `required_providers` block at the top level of your `tfcomponent.hcl` file.

The `required_providers` block declares which providers your Stack requires, so Terraform can install and use them. Whenever you define a provider, you must also add that provider to `required_providers` to ensure the Terraform CLI knows where to source the provider and which version to download.

The Terraform CLI uses the `required_providers` block to download the listed providers and compute provider lock hashes. To learn more and view examples, refer to [Declare providers](/terraform/language/stacks/component/declare-providers).

## Configuration model

The `required_providers` block supports the following arguments:

- [`required_providers`](#required_providers) &nbsp; block
  - [`<PROVIDER_NAME>`](#provider_name) &nbsp; block
    - [`source`](#source) &nbsp; string
    - [`version`](#version) &nbsp; string

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `required_providers` block:

```hcl
required_providers {
  <PROVIDER_NAME> = {
    source  = "<PROVIDER_SOURCE>"
    version = "<VERSION_CONSTRAINT>"
  }
}
```

## Specification

A `required_providers` block supports the following configuration.

### `required_providers`

The `required_providers` block contains one or more provider requirement declarations. Each declaration specifies a provider name and its requirements.

```hcl
required_providers {
  <PROVIDER_NAME> = {
    source  = "<PROVIDER_SOURCE>"
    version = "<VERSION_CONSTRAINT>"
  }
  <PROVIDER_TWO_NAME> = {
    source  = "<PROVIDER_SOURCE>"
    version = "<VERSION_CONSTRAINT>"
  }
}
```

### `<PROVIDER_NAME>`

Each provider declaration uses the provider name as a key that maps to a block with the provider's requirements. You can reference the same provider name in [`provider` blocks](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/provider) to further configure that provider.

The following arguments are supported for each provider:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | The global source address for the provider. | String | Required |
| `version` | A version constraint specifying which versions of the provider are acceptable. | String | Required |

### `source`

The `source` argument specifies the global source address for the provider, telling Terraform where to find the provider.

```hcl
required_providers {
  aws = {
    source = "hashicorp/aws"
  }
}
```

Refer to each Terraform providerâ€™s documentation in the [public Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers), or your [private HCP Terraform registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry), for instructions on how to configure attributes in the `required_providers` block.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `version`

The `version` argument specifies a version constraint that determines which versions of the provider are acceptable.

```hcl
required_providers {
  aws = {
    source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    version = "~> 5.7.0"
  }
}
```

Refer to [Version constraints](/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints) for details on how to specify version constraints.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

## Examples

In the following example, the `required_providers` block declares the AWS and random providers with specific version constraints:

```hcl
required_providers {
  aws = {
    source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    version = "~> 5.7.0"
  }
  random = {
    source  = "hashicorp/random"
    version = "~> 3.5.1"
  }
}
```
