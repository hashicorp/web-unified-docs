# `output` block reference for component configurations

Use the `output` block in a Stack to expose information about your Stack's infrastructure in the HCP Terraform UI.

## Background

Define `output` blocks in the `<NAME>.tfcomponent.hcl` file, to expose information about your Stack's infrastructure in the HCP Terraform UI.

If you want to expose a value from a Stack to use another Stack, refer to [Pass data from one Stack to another](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/pass-data) instead. If you are declaring a `output` block in a traditional Terraform configuration file, ending in `.tf`, refer to the Terraform configuration [`output` block reference](/terraform/language/block/output) instead.

## Configuration model

The `output` block supports the following arguments:

- [`output "<LABEL>"`](#output) &nbsp; block
  - [`type`](#type) &nbsp; type constraint
  - [`value`](#value) &nbsp; expression
  - [`description`](#description) &nbsp; string
  - [`sensitive`](#sensitive) &nbsp; boolean
  - [`ephemeral`](#ephemeral) &nbsp; boolean

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `output` block:

```hcl
output "<LABEL>" {
  description = "<STRING>"
  type        = <TYPE>
  value       = <EXPRESSION>
  sensitive   = <true|false>
  ephemeral   = <true|false>
}
```

## Specification

In a component configuration file, the `output` block supports the following configuration.

### `output "<LABEL>"`

The label after the `output` keyword is a name for the output, which must be unique among all outputs in the same component configuration. The name of an output can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers).

The following arguments are supported in an `output` block:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | The type constraint for this output value. | Type constraint | Required |
| `value` | The value Terraform returns for this output. | Expression | Required |
| `description` | A description of the output's purpose and how to use it. | String | Optional |
| `sensitive` | Specifies if Terraform hides this value in the UI and logs. | Boolean | Optional |
| `ephemeral` | Specifies that Terraform must exclude this value from plans and state. | Boolean | Optional |

### `type`

The `type` argument specifies the type constraint for the output value. Component configurations require you to explicitly define the type of each output.

```hcl
output "<LABEL>" {
  type  = <TYPE_CONSTRAINT>
  #...
}
```

For details about types, constructors, and conversions, refer to [Type constraints](/terraform/language/expressions/types).

#### Summary

- Data type: Type constraint
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `value`

The `value` argument specifies the expression that Terraform evaluates and exposes to the HCP Terraform UI.

```hcl
output "<LABEL>" {
  type  = <TYPE_CONSTRAINT>
  value = <EXPRESSION>
}
```

In component configurations, outputs commonly reference component outputs and other Stack resources, such as `component.<COMPONENT_NAME>.<OUTPUT_NAME>`.

#### Summary

- Data type: Expression
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `description`

The `description` argument documents the purpose of the output and how consumers should use it.

```hcl
output "<LABEL>" {
  description = "<DESCRIPTION>"
  type        = <TYPE_CONSTRAINT>
  value       = <EXPRESSION>
}
```

Write descriptions from the perspective of someone consuming this Stack's outputs to help them understand the output's purpose and usage.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: No

### `sensitive`

The `sensitive` argument prevents Terraform from displaying the output value in the HCP Terraform UI and logs.

```hcl
output "<LABEL>" {
  description = "<DESCRIPTION>"
  type        = <TYPE_CONSTRAINT>
  value       = <EXPRESSION>
  sensitive   = <BOOLEAN>
}
```

When you set `sensitive` to `true`, the HCP Terraform UI displays the output as `(sensitive value)` instead of showing the actual value. Terraform still records sensitive values in state, so anyone with state access can view these values. For more information about safely storing sensitive data, refer to [Manage sensitive data](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data).

#### Summary

- Data type: Boolean
- Default: `false`
- Required: No

### `ephemeral`

The `ephemeral` argument excludes the output value from plans and state data, making it available only during runtime.

```hcl
output "<LABEL>" {
  description = "<DESCRIPTION>"
  type        = <TYPE_CONSTRAINT>
  value       = <EXPRESSION>
  ephemeral   = <BOOLEAN>
}
```

Ephemeral outputs are useful for temporary values like session tokens or short-lived credentials that you don't want to persist in state.

You can only reference ephemeral variables from specific contexts or Terraform throws an error:
- In a managed resource [write-only argument](/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral/write-only)
- In an [`ephemeral` block](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- In the [`locals` block](/terraform/language/block/locals)
- In other [`variable` blocks with the `ephemeral` argument set to `true`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/variable#ephemeral)
- In other [`output` blocks with the `ephemeral` argument set to `true`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/output#ephemeral)
- Configuring [providers in the `provider` block](/terraform/language/functions/terraform-applying)
- In [provisioner](/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) and [connection](/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/connection) blocks

#### Summary

- Data type: Boolean
- Default: `false`
- Required: No

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `output` blocks in component configurations.

### Fundamental component output

In the following example, the `instance_ip` output exposes the `private_ip` value from the `web_server` component as a string:

```hcl
output "instance_ip" {
  description = "The private IP address of the web server"
  type        = string
  value       = component.web_server.private_ip
}
```
