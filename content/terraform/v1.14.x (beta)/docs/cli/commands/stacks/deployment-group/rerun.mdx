# `terraform stacks deployment-group rerun` reference

Use the `terraform stacks deployment-group rerun` command to rerun deployments within a deployment group.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks <global-stacks-flags> deployment-group rerun -deployment-names <value> <options>
```

## Description

Reruns deployments within a deployment group. Either `-deployment-group-id` must be provided, or `-deployment-group-name` in conjunction with the arguments `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` must be provided. If names are used, the deployment group associated with the latest configuration for the specified stack will be targeted.

## Options

- `-deployment-names`: A comma-separated list of deployment names to rerun within the deployment group.
    - Required.
    - Data type: string (comma-separated list).

- `-organization-name`: The name of the organization to target.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_ORGANIZATION_NAME` if provided.

- `-project-name`: The name of the project to target.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_PROJECT_NAME` if provided.

- `-stack-name`: The name of the Stack to target.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_STACK_NAME` if provided.

- `-deployment-group-name`: The name of the deployment group to rerun within the latest configuration of the Stack specified in `-stack-name`.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Requires the arguments `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` to be provided.

- `-deployment-group-id`: The ID of the deployment group to rerun.
    - Optional (but required if not using `-deployment-group-name`)
    - Data type: string.
    - Has precedence over `-deployment-group-name` if both are provided.


## Examples

The following command reruns specific deployments within a deployment group using the deployment group ID:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-group rerun -deployment-group-id dg-abc123 -deployment-names "prod-east,prod-west"
```

The following command reruns deployments using deployment group name and Stack information:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-group rerun -organization-name my-org -project-name my-project -stack-name my-stack -deployment-group-name production -deployment-names "api-deployment,db-deployment"
```
