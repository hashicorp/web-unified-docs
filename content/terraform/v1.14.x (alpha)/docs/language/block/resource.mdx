## Complete configuration

The following `resource` block defines all of the supported built-in arguments you can set on a resource:

```hcl

}
```

## Specification

A `resource` block supports the following configuration.

### `resource "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`

You must set the following arguments for every `resource` block:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the type of resource to create. You can declare either a resource type determined by the provider or the built-in `terraform_data` resource type, which stores values and triggers Terraform operations without creating actual infrastructure. For information about provider resource types, refer to the provider documentation.
- `LABEL`: Specifies a name for the resource. Terraform uses this label to track the resource in your state file. The label does not affect settings on the actual infrastructure resource. Refer to [References to Named Values](/terraform/language/expressions/references) and [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) for expression syntax and label recommendations.

To reference the resource in your configuration, you must refer to it using `<TYPE>.<LABEL>` syntax.

### `PROVIDER ARGUMENTS`

The provider developer determines which arguments you can define for a resource. Refer to the provider documentation for details.

### `count`

The `count` meta-argument instructs Terraform to provision multiple instances of the same resource with identical or similar configuration.

```hcl
resource {
  count = <number>
}
```

The value must be a whole number. You can reference variables or local values and use expressions to compute the value, but the value must resolve to a whole number.

In blocks where `count` is set, Terraform exposes an additional `count` object. You can reference the object to modify the configuration of each instance. The `count` object has an `index` attribute starting from `0`.

To refer to an individual instance of a resource created using the `count` meta-argument, use the `<TYPE>.<NAME>[INDEX]` syntax. For example, `aws_instance.server[0]` refers to the first instance of the `aws_instance` resource named `server`.

<Tip>

You can use the `count` argument as a conditional for creating resources. For example, setting a `count = var.creator ? 3 : 0` instructs Terraform to create three instances of the resource when a variable named `creator` is set to `true`. Refer to [​​Conditional Expressions](/terraform/language/expressions/conditionals) for more information.

</Tip>

The `count` argument is a meta-argument, which is built into Terraform and controls the way that Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

#### Summary

- Data type: Number.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Create multiple instances of a resource](#create-multiple-instances-of-a-resource).

### `depends_on`

The `depends_on` meta-argument specifies an upstream resource that the resource depends on. Terraform must complete all operations on the upstream resource before performing operations on the resource containing the `depends_on` argument.

```hcl
resource {
  depends_on = [ <resource reference> ]
}
```

When a resource configuration refers to another resource, Terraform identifies the dependency and creates the upstream resource first. In some cases, you may need Terraform to create a resource before creating another, even though the resources are configured independently.

Use the `depends_on` argument when the resources do not reference each other. We recommend always including a comment to explain resource dependencies when using a `depends_on` argument.

When using the `depends_on` meta-argument, you can only reference other resources or child modules in the same root module. The list cannot include arbitrary expressions. Any values referenced in the `depends_on` list must be known before Terraform begins the operation so that it can evaluate dependencies.

Specifying an entire module in the `depends_on` argument affects the order in which Terraform provisions all of the resources and data sources associated with that module. Refer to [Resource dependencies](/terraform/language/resources/configure#specify-resource-dependencies) <!-- placeholder link -->
and [Data resource dependencies](/terraform/language/resources/configure#specify-resource-dependencies) for more information.

The `depends_on` argument is a meta-argument, which is built into Terraform and controls the way that Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

#### Summary

- Data type: List.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Specify a dependency](#specify-a-dependency).

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta-argument instructs Terraform to provision similar resources without requiring separate configuration blocks for each resource.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="List of values">

```hcl
resource {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ]
  # . . .
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
resource {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `for_each` meta-argument accepts a map or a set of strings and creates an instance for each item in that map or set. Each instance is associated with a distinct infrastructure object. Terraform creates, updates, or destroys each instance when applying changes to the configuration.

You can use pure functions, such as `toset()` and `tomap()`, to create a map or set for use in the `for_each` argument. Whether iterating over the keys of a map or set of strings, all must be known values. Otherwise, Terraform prints an error message that `for_each` has dependencies that it cannot determine before applying the configuration.

Keys in the `for_each` argument cannot be the result of or rely on the result of impure functions, including `uuid`, `bcrypt`, or `timestamp`, because Terraform defers evaluating impure functions during the main evaluation step.

The `for_each` argument does not implicitly convert lists or tuples to sets. To declare resource instances based on a nested data structure or combinations of elements from multiple data structures, you can use Terraform expressions and functions to derive a suitable value. Refer to the following examples for more information:

- [Transform a multi-level nested structure into a flat list](/terraform/language/functions/flatten#flattening-nested-structures-for-for_each).
- [Combine collections to produce a list of element combinations](/terraform/language/functions/setproduct#finding-combinations-for-for_each).

You cannot use sensitive values, such as [sensitive input variables](/terraform/language/block/variable#sensitive), [sensitive outputs](/terraform/language/block/output#sensitive), or [sensitive resource attributes](/terraform/language/expressions/references#sensitive-resource-attributes), as arguments in `for_each`. Terraform uses the value in `for_each` to identify the resource instance and always discloses it in UI output, so sensitive values are not allowed. Terraform returns an error if you attempt to use sensitive values as `for_each` arguments.

If you transform a value containing sensitive data into an argument for use in `for_each`, be aware that most functions in Terraform will return a sensitive result if given an argument with any sensitive content. In many cases, you can achieve similar results with a `for` expression. For example, to call `keys(local.map)` where `local.map` is an object with sensitive values, but non-sensitive keys, you can create a value to pass to `for_each` using `toset([for k,v in local.map : k])`.

Refer to [Manage sensitive data](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data) for more information.

The `for_each` argument exposes an `each` object that you can reference within the same block to modify specific instances of the resource. The object has the following attributes:

- `each.key`: Map key or list member that corresponds to an instance.
- `each.value`: Map value that corresponds to an instance.

Use the `<TYPE>.<NAME>[<KEY>]` syntax to access an instance of a resource created using `for_each`. For example, `azurerm_resource_group.rg["a_group"]` refers to an instance of the `azurrm_resource_group` resource named `rg` created off of the `a_group` key.

The `for_each` argument is a meta-argument, which is built into Terraform and controls the way that Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

#### Summary

- Data type: Map or set of strings.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Create multiple instances of a resource](#create-multiple-instances-of-a-resource).

### `provider`

The `provider` argument instructs Terraform to use an alternate provider configuration to provision the resource.

```hcl
resource {
  provider = <provider>.<alias>
}
```

By default, Terraform automatically selects a provider based on the resource type, but you can create multiple provider configurations and use a non-default configuration for specific resources.

Use the `<PROVIDER>.<ALIAS>` syntax to reference a provider configuration in the `provider` argument.

The `provider` argument is a meta-argument, which is built into Terraform and controls the way that Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

#### Summary

- Data type: Reference.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Select an alternate provider configuration](#select-an-alternate-provider-configuration).

### `lifecycle`

The `lifecycle` block defines lifecycle rules that instruct Terraform when and how to operate on your resource.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    <lifecycle>
  }
}
```

You can specify the following lifecycle rules to manage how Terraform performs operations on the resource:

- [`create_before_destroy`](#create_before_destroy): Terraform creates a replacement resource before destroying the current resource.
- [`prevent_destroy`](#prevent_destroy): Terraform rejects operations to destroy the resource and returns an error.
- [`ignore_changes`](#ignore_changes):  Specifies a list of resource attributes that Terraform ignores changes to. Otherwise, Terraform attempts to update the actual resource to match the configuration.
- [`replace_triggered_by`](#replace-triggered_by): Terraform replaces the resource when any of the referenced resources or specified attributes change.
- [`precondition`](#precondition): Specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates before creating the resource. Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for more information.
- [`postcondition`](#postcondition): Specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates after creating the resource. Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for more information.

Configurations defined in the `lifecycle` block affect how Terraform constructs and traverses the dependency graph. You can only use literal values in the lifecycle block because Terraform processes them before it evaluates arbitrary expressions for a run.

The `lifecycle` block is a meta-argument. Meta-arguments are built-in arguments that control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None

### `create_before_destroy`

The `create_before_destroy` argument instructs Terraform to create a replacement resource before destroying the resource it replaces.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = <boolean>
  }
}
```

By default, Terraform destroys a resource before creating a replacement.

Refer to the documentation for the resource type you are configuring to understand which changes Terraform can make in-place and which require recreating the resource to decide whether to use the `create_before_destroy` argument.

Terraform propagates and applies the `create_before_destroy` behavior to all resource dependencies. For example, if `create_before_destroy` is enabled on resource A but not on resource B, but resource A is dependent on resource B, then Terraform enables `create_before_destroy` for resource B implicitly and records it in the state file. You cannot override `create_before_destroy` to `false` on resource B because that would imply dependency cycles in the graph.

Setting`create_before_destroy` to `true` on a resource stops any configured destroy provisioners.

#### Summary

- Data type: Boolean
- Default: None.

### `prevent_destroy`

The `prevent_destroy` argument instructs Terraform to reject plans to destroy the resource.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = <boolean>
  }
}
```

Use this argument to prevent team members from accidentally replacing critical infrastructure, such as database instances.

When the `prevent_destroy` argument is set, you must either remove the resource from the configuration or change the `prevent_destroy` argument to `false` to destroy it. Use this argument with caution. The `prevent_destroy` argument can make applying resource changes or destroying resources more complex.

#### Summary

- Data type: Boolean.
- Default: None.

### `ignore_changes`

The `ignore_changes` argument specifies a list of resource attributes for Terraform to ignore when planning updates to the resource.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [ <attribute> ]
  }
}
```

Use this argument when the resource references data that may change but does not affect the resource after its creation.

By default, Terraform detects any difference in the current settings of a real infrastructure object and plans to update the remote object to match the configuration.

Terraform uses the specified arguments to create a resource, but ignores them when planning an `update` operation. You can specify arguments as the relative attribute addresses in the resource and reference members of maps and lists using index notation, such as `tags["Name"]` and `list[0]`.

You can also specify `all` instead of a list to ignore future changes to all resource attributes. This lets Terraform create and destroy the resource but it does not propose updates to it.

#### Summary

- Data type: List.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Ignore attribute changes](#ignore-attribute-changes).

### `replace_triggered_by`

The `replace_triggered_by` argument instructs Terraform to replace the resource when any of the referenced items change.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [ <address.reference> ]
  }
}
```

You can specify a list of expressions that reference managed resources, instances, or instance attributes. You can only reference managed resources in `replace_triggered_by` expressions. This lets you modify these expressions without forcing replacement.

The trigger is based on the planned actions for all of the given resources. Terraform does not plan actions for plain values, such as local values or input variables, but you can use the `terraform_data` resource type to apply a resource-like lifecycle to them.

References in the argument list trigger a replacement under following conditions:

- When referencing a resource with multiple instances, such as those created by `count` or `for_each`, a `terraform plan` command to update or replace any instance triggers replacement.
- When referencing a single resource instance, a `terraform plan` command to update or replace that instance triggers replacement.
- When referencing a single attribute of a resource instance, any change to the attribute value triggers replacement.

Adding the `replace_triggered_by` argument to a resource that uses `count` or `for_each` lets you add the `count.index` or `each.key` resource address to the expression. Use this address segment to reference specific instances of other resources that are configured with the same `count` or collection.

#### Summary

- Data type: List
- Default: None.
- Example: [Specify triggers that replace resources](#specify-triggers-that-replace-resources)

### `precondition`

The `precondition` block specifies a condition that must return `true` before Terraform evaluates and performs operations on the resource. You can also specify an error message for Terraform to print when the condition returns `false`.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition = <expression>
      error_message = "<message>"
    }
  }
}
```

The following arguments in the `precondition` block are required:

| Argument | Description | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | Expression that must return `true` for Terraform to proceed with an operation. You can refer to any other object in the same configuration scope unless the reference creates a cyclic dependency. | Expression that can include references, strings, and operators. |
| `error_message` | Message that Terraform prints to the console if the `condition` returns `false`. | String |

Terraform evaluates `precondition` blocks before evaluating the resource's configuration arguments. The `precondition` can take precedence over argument evaluation errors.

Terraform evaluates precondition blocks after evaluating `count` and `for_each` meta-arguments. As a result, Terraform can evaluate the `precondition` separately for each instance and makes the `each.key` and `count.index` objects available in the conditions.

You can include a `precondition` and [`postcondition` block](#postcondition) in the same resource. Do not add `precondition` blocks to a `resource` block and a `data` block that represent the same object in the same configuration. Doing so can prevent Terraform from understanding that the data block result can be affected by changes in the resource block.

Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for information about adding validations to your Terraform configuration.

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Apply custom conditions](#apply-custom-conditions)

### `postcondition`

The `postcondition` block specifies a condition that must return `true` after Terraform performs operations on the resource. You can also specify an error message for Terraform to print to the console when the condition returns `false`.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition = <expression>
      error_message = "<message>"
    }
  }
}
```

The following arguments in the `precondition` block are required:

| Argument | Description | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | Expression that must return `true` for Terraform to perform operations on downstream resources. You can refer to any other object in the same configuration scope unless the reference creates a cyclic dependency. | Expression that can include references, strings, and operators. |
| `error_message` | Message that Terraform prints to the console if the `condition` returns `false`. | String |

Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for information about adding validations to your Terraform configuration.

Terraform evaluates `postcondition` blocks after planning and applying changes to the resource. Postcondition failures prevent changes to other resources that depend on the failing resource.

You can include a `postcondition` and [`precondition` block](#precondition) in the same resource. Do not add `postcondition` blocks to a `resource` block and a `data` block that represent the same object in the same configuration. Doing so can prevent Terraform from understanding that the data block result can be affected by changes in the resource block.

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Apply custom conditions](#apply-custom-conditions)

### `connection`

The `connection` block specifies settings that let provisioners connect to resources so that Terraform can perform operations on the resource after creating it.

<Warning>

We recommend using configuration management tools or other means to perform actions on the local or remote machine instead of using provisioners. Refer to [Perform post-apply action](/terraform/language/provisioners) for more information.

</Warning>

You can add the `connection` block to either the [`resource`](#resource) block or the [`provisioner`](#provisioner) block. When added to the `resource` block, the `connection` block sets default connection settings for all provisioners defined in the resource so that provisioners can connect to the remote resource after Terraform provisions it.

```hcl
resource {
  # . . .
  connection {
    <settings for all provisioners in the resource>
  }
}
```

When added to a `provisioner` block, the `connection` block defines settings specific to the provisioner.

```hcl
resource {
  # . . .
  provisioner {
    # . . .
    connection {
      <settings for all provisioners in the resource>
    }
  }
}
```

Terraform does not validate SSH host keys by default. You can establish a separate mechanism for key distribution and explicitly set the `host_key` argument to verify against a specific key or signing CA.

You can use ephemeral values for arguments in the `connection` block. Refer to [Manage sensitive data](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data) for more information.

Expressions in `connection` blocks cannot refer to their parent resource by name. References create dependencies, and referring to a resource by name within its own block would create a dependency cycle. Instead, use the `self` object in expressions to refer to the `connection` block's parent block, including all of its attributes. For example, use `self.public_ip` to reference the `public_ip` attribute in an `aws_instance`.

<span id="connection-arguments"/>

<Tip>

You can provide multiple connections so that an initial provisioner can connect as the root user to set up user accounts and subsequent provisioners can connect as less-privileged users to perform more specific operations.

</Tip>

The following table describes the arguments you can use in the `connection` block:

| Argument | Description | Data type | Connection | Default |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------| --- |
| `type` | Specifies the type of connection for sending and receiving data from the remote resource. You can specify `ssh` or `winrm`. When set to `winrm`, provisioners implement Windows-specific behaviors, even when `target_platform` is set to `unix`, unless otherwise specified.| string |  | `ssh` |
| `user` | Specifies the user to use for the connection. | string | `ssh`<p>`winrm`</p> | <p>`root` when `type` is `ssh`</p><p>`Administrator` when `type` is `winrm`</p> |
| `password` | Specifies the password to use for the connection. | string | `ssh`<p>`winrm`</p> | none |
| `host` | Specifies the address of the resource to connect to. <p>This argument is required.</p> | string | `ssh`<p>`winrm`</p> | none |
| `port` | Specifies the port number to connect to. | number | `ssh`<p>`winrm`</p> | <p>`22` when `type` is `ssh`</p><p>`5985` when `type` is `winrm`</p> |
| `timeout` | Specifies how long to wait for the connection to become available. | string | `ssh`<p>`winrm`</p> | `"5m"` |
| `script_path` | Specifies the path on the remote resource where Terraform copies scripts to. Refer to the [`provisioner` block reference](#provisioner) for more information. Terraform copies scripts to a path that contains random numbers depending on the `target_platform` configuration. | string | `ssh`<p>`winrm`</p> | <p>`/tmp/terraform_%RAND%.sh` when `target_platform` is `unix`</p><p>`C:/windows/temp/`<br/>`terraform_%RAND%.cmd` when `target_platform` is `windows`</p> |
| `private_key` | Specifies the contents of an SSH key to use for the connection. `private_key` takes precedence over `password` when both are provided. | <p>string</p><p>Use a [`file` function](/terraform/language/functions/file) to load keys from file.</p> | `ssh` | none |
| `certificate` | Specifies the contents of a signed CA certificate. You must also configure a  `private_key` arugment. | <p>string</p><p>Use a [`file` function](/terraform/language/functions/file) to load certificates from file.</p> | `ssh` | none |
| `agent` | Specifies an SSH agent for authentication. Set to `false` to disable using `ssh-agent` to authenticate. On Windows, the only supported SSH authentication agent is [Pageant](http://the.earth.li/\~sgtatham/putty/0.66/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant). | string | `ssh` | `false` |
| `agent_identity` | Specifies the preferred identity from the SSH agent to use for authentication. | string | `ssh` | none |
| `host_key` | Specifies the public key from the remote host or the signing CA to verify the connection. | string | `ssh` | none |
| `target_platform` | Specifies the target platform, which affects the default value for the `script_path` argument. You can specify either `windows` or `unix`. <p>`windows` sets the default `script_path` to `c:\windows\temp\terraform_%RAND%.cmd` if the default SSH shell on the remote resource is `cmd.exe`. Refer to the [Windows documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_server_configuration#configuring-the-default-shell-for-openssh-in-windows) for more information. If the SSH default shell is PowerShell, set `script_path` to `"c:/windows/temp/terraform_%RAND%.ps1"`.</p><p>`unix` sets the default `script_path` to `/tmp/terraform_%RAND%.sh`. </p> | string | `ssh` |`unix` |
| `https` | Set to `true` to connect using HTTPS instead of HTTP. | boolean | `winrm` | `false` |
| `insecure` | Set to `true` to skip validating the HTTPS certificate chain. | boolean | `winrm` | `false` |
| `use_ntlm` | Set to `true` to use NTLM authentication instead of basic authentication. Using NTLM removes the requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target guest. Refer to [Authentication for Remote Connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/authentication-for-remote-connections) in the Windows App Development documentation for more details. | boolean | `winrm` | `false` |
| `cacert` | Specifies the CA certificate to validate against. | string | `winrm` | none |
| `bastion_host` | Specifies the address of the bastion host. The provisioner connects to `bastion_host` before connecting to `host`. | string | `ssh` | none |
| `bastion_host_key` | Specifies the public key from the remote host or the signing CA to verify the host connection. | string | `ssh` | none |
| `bastion_port` | Specifies the port number to use for the bastion host connection. | string | `ssh` | value of the `port` field|
| `bastion_user`| Specifies the user name for connecting to the bastion host. | string | `ssh` | value of the `user` field |
| `bastion_password` | Specifies the user password for connecting to the bastion host. | string | `ssh` | value of the `password` field |
| `bastion_private_key` | Specifies the contents of an SSH key file to use for the bastion host. | <p>string</p><p>Use a [`file` function](/terraform/language/functions/file) to load keys from file.</p> | `ssh` | value of the `private_key` field |
| `bastion_certificate` |  Specifies the contents of a signed CA certificate. You must also configure the `bastion_private_key` argument when providing the certificate for the bastion host. | <p>string</p><p>Use a [`file` function](/terraform/language/functions/file) to load certificates from file.</p> | `ssh` | value of the `certificate` field |
| `proxy_scheme` | Specifies the connection protocol. You can specify one of the following values: <li>`http`</li><li>`https`</li><li> `socks5`</li> | string | `ssh` | none |
| `proxy_host` | Specifies the address of the proxy host. The provisioner connects to the proxy host first. When `bastion_host` is configured, the provisioner connects to the bastion host next, otherwise the provisioner connects to the host specified in the `host` argument.  | string | `ssh` | none |
| `proxy_port` | Specifies the port number to use for the proxy host connection. | number | `ssh` | none |
| `proxy_user_name` | Specifies the user name for connecting to the proxy host. You should only configure this argument when the proxy server requires authentication. | string | `ssh` | none |
| `proxy_user_password` | Specifies the user password for connecting to the proxy host. You should only configure this argument when the proxy server requires authentication. | string | `ssh` | none |

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Connect to remote resources](#connect-to-remote-resources)

### `provisioner`

The `provisioner` block defines actions to perform on the local machine or created resource, such as preparing servers or other infrastructure objects for service.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "<TYPE>" {
    <arguments>
  }
}
```

<Warning>

We recommend using configuration management tools or other means to perform actions on the local or remote machine instead of using the `provisioner` block. Refer to [Perform post-apply action](/terraform/language/provisioners) for more information.

</Warning>

The `provisioner` block supports the following arguments:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the type of provisioner to use. You must specify one of the following types:
  - `file`: Copies files or directories from the machine where Terraform is running to the new resource. When the file provisioner communicates with a Windows system over SSH, you must configure OpenSSH to run the commands with `cmd.exe` and not PowerShell. PowerShell causes file parsing errors because it is incompatible with both Unix shells and the Windows command interpreter.
  - `local-exec`: Invokes an executable on the local machine after Terraform creates the resource.
  - `remote-exec`: Invokes an executable on the remote resource after Terraform creates the resource.
- `LABEL`: Optional attribute for adding a unique name. Refer to [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) for label recommendations.

The type of provisioner determines which arguments you can add to the block. All types can use the [`connection`](#connection) argument. The following table lists each type's supported arguments:

| Provisioner type | Arguments |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | <li>[`source`](#source)</li><li>[`content`](#content)</li><li>[`destination`](#destination)</li> |
| `local-exec` | <li>[`command`](#command)</li><li>[`working_dir`](#working_dir)</li><li>[`interpreter`](#interpreter)</li><li>[`environment`](#command)</li><li>[`when`](#when)</li><li>[`quiet`](#quiet)</li> |
| `remote-exec` | <li>[`inline`](#inline)</li><li>[`script`](#script)</li><li>[`scripts`](#scripts)</li> |
| All types | <li>[`connection`](#connection)</li> <li>[`on_failure`](#on_failure)</li> |

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.

### `source`

The `source` specifies the location of a file or directory to copy to the location specified in the [`destination`](#destination) argument.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "file" {
    source = "<path>"
  }
}
```


You can specify a string value that contains an expression. You can't use the `source` argument and the [`content`](#content) argument in the same `provisioner "file"` block.

When the `source` argument specifies a directory and the `type` argument in the [provisioner connection settings](#connection) is set to `ssh`, the corresponding directory specified in the `destination` argument must already exist. You can add a `provisioner "remote-exec"` block to your `resource` configuration to create the directory. If the directory does not already exist, Terraform creates it when the `type` argument in the [provisioner connection settings](#connection) is set to `winrm`.

Adding a trailing slash to the `source` argument path instructs Terraform to copy the contents of the directory to the `destination` directory. For example, when `source = "/foo/"` and `destination = "/temp"`, Terraform uploads the contents of `/foo` directory into `/tmp`.

Without a trailing slash, Terraform creates the directory under the directory specified in the `destination`. For example, when `source = "/foo"` and `destination = "/temp"`, Terraform uploads the `/foo` directory to `/tmp/foo`.

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Copy content to new resources](#copy-content-to-new-resources).

### `content`

The `content` argument specifies content to write directly to the location specified in the [`destination`](#destination) argument.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "file" {
    content = "<content>"
  }
}
```


When `destination` points to a file, Terraform writes the value of the `content` argument to the file. When `destination` points to a directory, Terraform creates a file named `tf-file-content` inside the directory. We recommend setting the `destination` argument to a file when using `content` argument. Do not use the `content` argument and the [`source`](#source) argument in the same `provisioner "file"` block.

You can specify a string value that contains an expression. You can't use the `source` argument and the [`content`](#content) argument in the same `provisioner "file"` block.

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Copy content to new resources](#copy-content-to-new-resources).

### `destination`

The `destination` argument specifies a path on the remote resource that Terraform copies content to. You can use either [`source`](#source) or [`content`](#content) argument to provide content to the `destination` path.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "file" {
    destination = "<path>"
  }
}
```


The remote system, not Terraform, evaluates the path you provide in the `destination` argument. As a result, valid values can vary depending on the operating system and remote access software running on the target.

When the `type` argument in the [provisioner connection settings](#connection) is set to `ssh`, the provisioner passes the destination path as-is to the `scp` program on the remote host. By default, the OpenSSH `scp` implementation runs in the remote user's home directory. As a result, you can specify a relative path to upload into the home directory or an absolute path to upload to a different location.

The remote `scp` process runs with the access level of the user specified in the [provisioner connection settings](#connection), so permissions may prevent Terraform from writing directly to locations outside of the home directory.

When the `type` argument in the [provisioner connection settings](#connection) is set to `winrm`, Terraform uses PowerShell to interpret the `destination` path. As a result, you must not use meta-characters that PowerShell might interpret. You should specifically avoid including untrusted external input in your `destination` argument because doing so can let arbitrary PowerShell code execute on the remote system.

Terraform performs the following process over WinRM connections:

1. Generates a temporary filename in the directory set in the remote system's `TEMP` environment variable.
1. Generates a sequence of `echo` commands to gradually append base64-encoded chunks of the source file to the temporary file.
1. Uses an uploaded PowerShell script to read the temporary file, base64-decode, and write the raw result into the destination file.

Modern Windows systems support running an OpenSSH server, so we strongly recommend choosing SSH over WinRM.

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Copy content to new resources](#copy-content-to-new-resources).

### `command`

The `command` argument specifies a command for a local executable to run. You can specify an absolute path or a relative path to the current working directory.
```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "<path>"
  }
}
```

Terraform evaluates the command in a local shell and can use environment variables for variable substitution. We do not recommend using Terraform variables for variable substitution because doing so can lead to shell injection vulnerabilities. Instead, use the `environment` parameter and environment variable substitution. Refer to the following OWASP article for more information about injection flaws: [Code Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection).

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.
- This argument is required in the `provisioner "local-exec"` block.
- Example: [Invoke executables](#invoke-executables).

### `working_dir`

The `working_dir` block specifies the working directory where Terraform executes the command specified in the the [`command`](#command) argument. You can specify a relative path to the current working directory or an absolute path. The directory must already exist.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    working_dir = "<path>"
  }
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Invoke executables](#invoke-executables).

### `interpreter`

The `interpreter` block specifies a list of interpreter arguments for running the executable specified in the [`command`](#command) argument.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    interpreter = [ "<path/to/interpreter>", "<command argument>" ]
  }
}
```


The first argument in the list is a path to the interpreter. You can specify a relative path to the current working directory or an absolute path. If you do not specify an interpreter, Terraform uses operating system defaults.

#### Summary

- Data type: List.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Invoke executables](#invoke-executables).

### `environment`

The `environment` block specifies a block of key value pairs that represent the environment for running the command specified in the [`command`](#command) argument.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    environment {
      <KEY> = <VALUE>
    }
  }
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Invoke executables](#invoke-executables).

### `when`

The `when` argument specifies a Terraform command that triggers actions specified in the provisioner.

```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when = <Terraform command>
  }
}
```


When you run the specified Terraform command, Terraform performs run the command specified in the [`command`](#command) argument. Refer to [Destroy-time provisioners](terraform/language/resources/provisioners#destroy-time-provisioners) for instructions on using the `when` argument.

#### Summary

- Data type: Terraform command.
- Default: None.
- Example: [Invoke executables](#invoke-executables).

### `quiet`

The `quiet` argument disables printing the [`command`](#command) argument's output to `stdout`.


```hcl
resource {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    quiet = <boolean>
  }
}
```

When `quiet` is set to `true`, Terraform prints `"Suppressed by quiet=true"` to `stdout`. Terraform still prints the output of the command.


#### Summary

- Data type: Boolean.
- Default: None.

### `inline`

Specifies a list of command strings to execute on the remote resource.


```hcl
resource {
  # ...
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [ "<command>" ]
  }
}
```

The provisioner uses the remote resource's default shell unless you specify a shell as the first command, for example `#!/bin/bash`. You cannot add an `inline` argument in the same provisioner with `script` or `scripts`.

#### Summary

- Data type: List.
- Default: None.

### `script`

Specifies the relative or absolute path to a script on the local machine to copy and execute on the remote resource.


```hcl
resource {
  # ...
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    scripts = "<path-to-script>"
  }
}
```

You cannot add a `script` argument in the same provisioner with `inline` or `scripts`.

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.

### `scripts`

Specifies a list of relative or absolute paths to script files on the local machine to copy and execute on the remote resource.

```hcl
resource {
  # ...
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    scripts = [ "<path-to-script>" ]
  }
}
```

You cannot add a `scripts` argument in the same provisioner with `inline` or `script`.

#### Summary

- Data type: List.
- Default: None.

## Examples

The following examples show how to write configuration for common use cases.

### Define an AWS instance

The following example defines an `aws_instance` resource named `web`.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Create multiple instances of a resource

You can use either `count` or the `for_each` block to create multiple instances of a resource. The `count` argument is most suitable for creating multiple instances that are identical or nearly identical. The `for_each` argument is most suitable for creating multiple similar instances based on attributes defined in a map or set.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="count">

The following example creates one instance for each subnet provided in the input variable:

```hcl
variable "subnet_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {

  count = length(var.subnet_ids)

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = var.subnet_ids[count.index]

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index}"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="for_each">

The following example creates two instances that reference a map created using the `tomap()` function:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  for_each = tomap({
    a_group       = "eastus"
    another_group = "westus2"
  })
  name     = each.key
  location = each.value
}
```

The following example creates four instances using a set created with the `toset()` function:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user" "the-accounts" {
  for_each = toset(["Todd", "James", "Alice", "Dottie"])
  name     = each.key
}
```

In the following example, the `module` block creates an instance of the `publish_bucket` module for each element in the `for_each` set. It uses the `each.key` attribute to create a unique name for each bucket.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="my_buckets.tf">

```hcl
module "bucket" {
  for_each = toset(["assets", "media"])
  source   = "./publish_bucket"
  name     = "${each.key}_bucket"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="publish_bucket/bucket-and-cloudfront.tf">

```hcl
variable "name" {}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
   bucket = var.name
   #...
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "deploy_user" {
   #...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Specify a dependency

In the following example, the `aws_iam_instance_profile` resource references the `aws_iam_role` resource, instructing Terraform to create the upstream resource first. The `aws_iam_role_policy` resource configures an IAM policy that lets the EC2 instance access the S3 API.

Terraform infers that it must create the instance profile before the EC2 instance, but it cannot infer that the software running in the EC2 instance needs access to the S3 API in order to boot properly. As a result, the configuration explicitly instructs Terraform to create the `aws_iam_role_policy` first:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  name = "example"
  assume_role_policy = "..."
}

resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "example" {
  role = aws_iam_role.example.name
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "example" {
  name   = "example"
  role   = aws_iam_role.example.name
  policy = jsonencode({
    "Statement" = [{
      "Action" = "s3:*",
      "Effect" = "Allow",
    }],
  })
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "data.aws_ami.example.id"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.example
  depends_on = [
    aws_iam_role_policy.example
  ]
}

data "aws_ami" "example" {
  # AMI configuration
}
```

Note that the `aws_iam_role` resource is partially defined. Refer to the [AWS provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_role) for all configuration settings.

### Select an alternate provider configuration

In the following example, the `google_compute_instance` resource selects the provider configuration with the `europe` alias.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  region = "us-central1"
}

provider "google" {
  alias  = "europe"
  region = "europe-west1"
}

resource "google_compute_instance" "example" {
  provider = google.europe
  # ...
}
```

### Ignore attribute changes

In the following example, Terraform ignores changes to the resource's tags:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
   # ...

   lifecycle {
      ignore_changes = [tags]
   }
}
```

### Specify triggers that replace resources

In the following example, Terraform replaces `aws_appautoscaling_target` each time this instance of `aws_ecs_service` is replaced:

```hcl
resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "ecs_target" {
   ...
   lifecycle {
   replace_triggered_by = [
      aws_ecs_service.svc.id
     ]
   }
}
```

### Apply custom conditions

The following example includes several configurations that illustrate how to define `precondition` and `postcondition` arguments in the `lifecycle` meta-argument.

The following `data` block instructs Terraform to retrieve the ID of the `ami-abc123` AMI:

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "example" {
  owners = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "image-id"
    values = ["ami-abc123"]
  }
}
```

In the following code, the `precondition` block specifies that the AMI ID retrieved from the `data` block must include `x86_64` as its `architecture` attribute. The `postcondition` block specifies that the EC2 instance must be allocated a public DNS hostname. When either condition is not met, Terraform returns the `error_message` for the failed condition:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  ami           = data.aws_ami.example.id

  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition     = data.aws_ami.example.architecture == "x86_64"
      error_message = "The selected AMI must be for the x86_64 architecture."
    }

    postcondition {
      condition     = self.public_dns != ""
      error_message = "EC2 instance must be in a VPC that has public DNS hostnames enabled."
    }
  }
}
```

The following `data` block retrieves the root storage volume connected to the `aws_instance.example` EC2 instance using the `volume_id` attribute. When a `data` resource verifies the result of a managed resource declared in the same configuration, you must define the check in a `postcondition` block in the resource so that Terraform waits for changes to the managed resource to complete before reading the data resource.

```hcl
data "aws_ebs_volume" "example" {
  filter {
    name = "volume-id"
    values = [aws_instance.example.root_block_device[0].volume_id]
  }
  lifecycle {
    # The EC2 instance will have an encrypted root volume.
    postcondition {
      condition     = self.encrypted
      error_message = "The server's root volume is not encrypted."
    }
  }
}
output "api_base_url" {
  value = "https://${aws_instance.example.private_dns}:8433/"
}
```

### Copy content to new resources

The following examples use the `file` provisioner type to copy artifacts from the machine where Terraform is running to the newly created resource.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Copies the myapp.conf file to /etc/myapp.conf
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
    destination = "/etc/myapp.conf"
  }

  # Copies the string in content into /tmp/file.log
  provisioner "file" {
    content     = "ami used: ${self.ami}"
    destination = "/tmp/file.log"
  }

  # Copies the configs.d folder to /etc/configs.d
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "conf/configs.d"
    destination = "/etc"
  }

  # Copies all files and folders in apps/app1 to D:/IIS/webapp1
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "apps/app1/"
    destination = "D:/IIS/webapp1"
  }
}
```

### Invoke executables

You can configure provisioners to perform remote operations, such as executing scripts or running commands.

In the following example, Terraform connects to the `web` instance using the `connection` settings so that the `remote-exec` provisioner can run the `puppet apply` and `consul join` commands on the resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```

In the following example, Terraform uploads a script to the instance and provides inline commands to run the script:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "script.sh"
    destination = "/tmp/script.sh"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "chmod +x /tmp/script.sh",
      "/tmp/script.sh args",
    ]
  }
}
```

### Connect to remote resources

The following example establishes a connection that all provisioners in the `resource` block can use to run commands on the remote resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...


  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```

### Define provisioner failure behaviors

In the following example, Terraform runs the `echo` command on the local machine after creating the `web` resource. Terraform continues with the operation if the command fails:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command    = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
    on_failure = continue
  }
}
```
