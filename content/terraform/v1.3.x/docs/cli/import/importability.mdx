# Resource Importability

Each resource in Terraform must implement some basic logic to become
importable. As a result, you cannot import all Terraform resources.

The resources that you can import are documented at the bottom of
each resource documentation page in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/). If you have issues importing a resource, report an issue in the relevant provider repository.

To make a resource importable, refer to [Extending Terraform: Resources — Import](/plugin/sdkv2/resources/import).
