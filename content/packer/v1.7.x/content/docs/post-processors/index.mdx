# Post-Processors

Post-processors run after the image is built by the builder and provisioned by
the provisioner(s). Post-processors are optional, and they can be used to

post-processors, please choose an option from the sidebar.

See [`post-processor`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/build/post-processor) and
[`post-processors`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/build/post-processors)
blocks documentations to learn more about working with post-processors.
