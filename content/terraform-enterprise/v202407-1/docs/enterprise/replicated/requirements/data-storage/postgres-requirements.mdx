# PostgreSQL Requirements for Terraform Enterprise

-> **Note:** These requirements apply to the External Services operational mode, not the Mounted Disk operational mode. Refer to the [Pre-Install Checklist](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/pre-install-checklist) for more information.

<Note title="PostgreSQL v12 End of Life">
  PostgreSQL v12 will reach end of life on November 12, 2024, and as a result will no 
  longer be supported in Terraform Enterprise after that date.
