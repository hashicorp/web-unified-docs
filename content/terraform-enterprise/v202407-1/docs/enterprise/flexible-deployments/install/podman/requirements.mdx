  Requirements for installing Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options with Podman.

# Podman requirements

You must meet the following requirements before installing Terraform Enterprise on [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation).

## Versions

- A Podman version greater than or equal to v4.3.0.
- Any supported Linux OS, note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) users must use RHEL 8+


## Install Podman

Follow [the installation documentation](https://podman.io/docs/installation) for Podman on a Linux
distribution of your choice.


## Enable the Podman socket

Set up Podman’s docker-compatible REST API that runs as a `systemd` socket-activated service:

```sh
systemctl enable --now podman.socket
```

## HTTP/S Ports
Because Podman does not expose privileged ports, ensure that you set the following environment variables and ports in
the Kubernetes pod specification.

Set these environment variables in the `kube.yaml`:
```yaml
- name: "TFE_HTTP_PORT"
  value: "8080"
- name: "TFE_HTTPS_PORT"
  value: "8443"
```

Set these ports in the `kube.yaml`:
```yaml
"ports":
- "containerPort": 8080
  "hostPort": 80
- "containerPort": 8443
  "hostPort": 443
- "containerPort": 9090
  "hostPort": 9090
```


## RHEL and SELinux

We recommend adding `type: spc_t` to the Kubernetes pod specification's security context when using volumes
for an unprivileged Podman container on an SELinux-enabled system. This setting ensures the correct permissions
are in place to access the volume when Terraform Enterprise creates the pod/container.

Set the security context in the `kube.yaml`:
```yaml
"securityContext":
  "seLinuxOptions":
    "type": "spc_t"
```


## Terraform Enterprise requirements

- You meet the [shared requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements) for all Flexible deployment methods.

- A DNS hostname for accessing Terraform Enterprise.

- A [TLS certificate and private key for your DNS hostname](#tls-certificate).

- A [HashiCorp-issued Terraform Enterprise license](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/license).

-> **Note:** For exisiting Terraform Enterprise users with [Replicated deployments](/terraform/enterprise/replicated), refer to [Migrating to Flexible Deployment Options](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration).

### TLS certificate

You need three TLS certificate files:

- `cert.pem` - The end-entity certificate for your DNS hostname with any intermediate certificates appended to it.

- `key.pem` - The private key for the end-entity certificate. Must not be protected by a passphrase.

- `bundle.pem` - Additional certificates to be added to the Certificate Authority (CA) bundle.

If you’re using a certificate from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), those file names map to the following Terraform Enterprise files:

| Terraform Enterprise | Let’s Encrypt   |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| `key.pem`            | `privkey.pem`   |
| `cert.pem`           | `fullchain.pem` |
| `bundle.pem`         | `fullchain.pem` |

If you do not have a certificate, you can generate a self-signed one. Use the
`-nodes` option in your command since Terraform Enterprise cannot
use a private key that is protected by a passphrase.

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365
```

Be sure to replace `<terraform.example.com>` with the hostname you use
to access Terraform Enterprise.

```shell
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:HashiCorp, Inc.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Engineering
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:<terraform.example.com>
Email Address []:
```

When done, you’ll have your `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files but no `bundle.pem`
file.

Create your `bundle.pem` like so:

```bash
$ cp cert.pem bundle.pem
```
