# Upgrade Terraform Enterprise

This topic describes how to upgrade Terraform Enterprise installations on flexible deployment runtimes. HashiCorp no longer supports the Replicated Native Scheduler option. If you maintain a legacy Replicated deployment, refer to [Upgrade Terraform Enterprise on Replicated](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades) for archival guidance only.

## Introduction

We recommend upgrading in a test environment first before upgrading the production instance of Terraform Enterprise.

## Plan your upgrade

Complete the following tasks before you schedule downtime:

- **Required — Confirm compatibility**: Identify the Terraform Enterprise version you plan to install. Compare the supported platforms and dependency versions in the [release tables](/terraform/enterprise/releases) with your current infrastructure. Review the release notes for the target version and every intermediate version for breaking changes, deprecations, and new requirements.
- **Required — Map required releases**: Use the "Last required release" marker on the target version page (for example, [Terraform Enterprise 1.1.x](/terraform/enterprise/releases/1.1.x)) to determine which previous releases you must install first. Repeat this comparison for each required release until you reach your current running version. Document the sequence so you know which packages to stage. See the [Example upgrade path](#example-upgrade-path) for a sample workflow.
- **Required — Prepare the environment**: 
  - Freeze automation that could start runs.
  - Notify stakeholders.
  - Verify that operating system, PostgreSQL, Redis, and container runtime versions are supported.
  - Prune unused images or volumes to free capacity. *(Docker, Podman)*
  - Export configuration files (`settings.json`, `terraform.hcl`, Helm values, Docker Compose files).
  - Capture Terraform Enterprise usage data that you may need for validation.
- **Required — Back up and stage rollback assets**: 
  - Create fresh snapshots of external services, including PostgreSQL, object storage, and Redis.
  - Download required application images for each release in your upgrade path.
  - Define the conditions that trigger a rollback.
  - Verify that you can restore data and configuration quickly if the upgrade fails.
- **Recommended — Test the upgrade path**: Rehearse the full sequence in a test environment that mirrors production. Validate that required releases install cleanly, dependencies meet the target version requirements, and automation resumes as expected after the upgrade.

### Example upgrade path

The following scenario shows how to build an upgrade path from a monthly release to a milestone release:

1. Your production environment runs Terraform Enterprise `v202401-1`.
1. Your target version is Terraform Enterprise `1.1.0`.
1. Visit the [Terraform Enterprise 1.1.x releases page](/terraform/enterprise/releases/1.1.x) and note that `1.1.0` lists `v202406-1` as the last required release.
1. Visit the [Terraform Enterprise 2024 releases](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1) page. `v202406-1` requires no earlier release, so your full upgrade sequence is `v202401-1` → `v202406-1` → `1.1.0`.
1. Stage the images and release notes for each hop. Use the planning checklist at the end of this topic to coordinate backups, notifications, and testing before you promote the upgrade to production.

## Execute the upgrade

After you complete the planning tasks, perform the following steps to upgrade Terraform Enterprise. The specific commands vary by runtime, but the overall process is the same.

<Note>

OpenShift users should follow the instructions in the **Helm Chart** tab, as OpenShift deployments use Helm for application management.

</Note>

1. Back up your Terraform Enterprise data. Refer to [Backup and restore](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/backup-restore) for instructions.

1. Use the Terraform Enterprise CLI to stop any existing Terraform runs and prevent Terraform Enterprise from starting new operations. Refer to [Gracefully stop work on a node](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/cli#gracefully-stop-work-on-a-node) for instructions.

1. If your deployment is configured to run multiple `terraform-enterprise` nodes, scale down to a single node. You can run multiple nodes when Terraform Enterprise is in `active-active` mode. Refer to  [Configure the operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for additional information.

   <Note>

   The method for scaling down varies by runtime:
   - **Kubernetes/Helm**: Set `replicaCount: 1` in your values file
   - **Docker Compose**: Stop additional service instances or update the compose file
   - **Nomad**: Update the job specification's `count` to 1
   - **Podman**: Stop additional pods or containers

   </Note>

1. If your deployment uses an autoscaling group to manage instances of Terraform Enterprise, disable any configured health checks that would trigger the autoscaling group to rotate Terraform Enterprise instances during an upgrade.

   <Note>

   This step applies to orchestrated environments (Kubernetes, Nomad, OpenShift) where the platform manages instance health and automatic replacement. Skip this step if you use Docker Compose or standalone Podman deployments.

   </Note>

1. Stop the Terraform Enterprise application.

  <Tabs>
    <Tab heading="Docker Compose" group="first">

    Stop all running containers:

    ```shell-session
    $ docker compose down
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Helm Chart" group="second">

    Scale down the deployment by setting the replica count to zero in your `values.yaml` file:
    
    ```yaml
    replicaCount: 0
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Podman" group="third">

    Stop the pod defined in your Kubernetes YAML:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman kube play --down <path_to_YAML_file>
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Nomad" group="fourth">

    Stop the Terraform Enterprise job:

    ```shell-session
    $ nomad job stop <tfe-job-name>
    ```

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

1. Pull the new Terraform Enterprise image for a specific [release](/terraform/enterprise/releases): `images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:vYYYYMM-#`.

  <Tabs>
    <Tab heading="Docker Compose" group="first">

    Update the image tag in your `compose.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
      name: terraform-enterprise
      services:
        tfe:
          image: images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Helm Chart" group="second">

    Update your `values.yaml` file with the new image tag and restore the replica count:

    ```yaml
      replicaCount: 1
      image:
      repository: images.releases.hashicorp.com
      name: hashicorp/terraform-enterprise
      tag: <vYYYYMM-#>
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Podman" group="third">

    Update the image tag in your `kube.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
      spec:
        image: "images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>"
        name: "terraform-enterprise"
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Nomad" group="fourth">

    Update the image tag in your Nomad job specification file:

    ```hcl
      variable "tfe_image" {
        description = "The TFE image to use"
        type        = string
        default     = "images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>"
      }
    ```

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

1. Start the Terraform Enterprise application with the new image.

  <Tabs>
    <Tab heading="Docker Compose" group="first">

    Start the containers with the updated image:

    ```shell-session
    $ docker compose up --detach
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Helm Chart" group="second">

    Apply the updated configuration using Helm:

    ```shell-session
    $ helm -n <TFE_NAMESPACE> upgrade --values=<OVERRIDES_FILE> terraform-enterprise hashicorp/terraform-enterprise
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Podman" group="third">

    Start the pod with the updated configuration:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman kube play <path_to_YAML_file>
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Nomad" group="fourth">

    Deploy the updated job specification:

    ```shell-session
    $ nomad job run \
      -var="tfe_image_username=$TFE_REGISTRY_USERNAME" \
      -var="tfe_image_password=$TFE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" \
      <path-to-tfe-job-spec>
    ```

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

1. If you performed the upgrade in a test environment, repeat steps 1-7 for the production instance of Terraform Enterprise.

## Validate the upgrade

After Terraform Enterprise starts on the new version, perform the following checks:

- Run health checks or preliminary tests for the application and dependent services.
- Confirm that planned release features or fixes appear as expected.
- Re-enable automation, autoscaling, and monitoring that you paused during the upgrade. *(Autoscaling applies to Kubernetes, Nomad, OpenShift)*
- Document the outcome, including any required release hops, for future upgrades.

If any health check fails or the application does not stabilize within the expected window:

1. Pause automated traffic and notify stakeholders.
1. Review application logs for migration errors or dependency mismatches.
1. If the issue is not resolved within your change window, restore snapshots and redeploy the previous Terraform Enterprise image. Contact HashiCorp Support with the collected logs for follow-up assistance.

## Quick planning checklist

- Target version selected and compatibility verified
- Required release sequence documented
- Maintenance window scheduled and change tickets approved
- Configuration exports captured (`settings.json`, `terraform.hcl`, Helm values, Compose files)
- Backups completed for PostgreSQL, Redis, and object storage
- New container images downloaded for each hop
- Rollback criteria defined and restore procedure rehearsed
- Test upgrade rehearsal completed (recommended)
- Stakeholders notified and monitoring paused as needed

If you encounter issues at any point, contact [HashiCorp Support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us) with your upgrade plan, release sequence, and the relevant logs.
