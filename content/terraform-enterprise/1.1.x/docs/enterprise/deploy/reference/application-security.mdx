# Terraform Enterprise security reference

This page explains the aspects of the Terraform security model that are unique to Terraform Enterprise. We recommend also reviewing the core concepts in [HCP Terraform Security model](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/security-model).

#### Disable Unneeded Admin Access

The port 8443 is reserved for the [Admin Console UI](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/access-admin-console.mdx) and the [System API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs#system-endpoints) by default. You can configure the port via [TFE_ADMIN_HTTPS_PORT](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tfe_admin_https_port). This port should only be exposed to infrastructure admins. 
To disable the Admin Console UI, you can set [TFE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_DISABLED](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tfe_admin_console_enabled) to true.
