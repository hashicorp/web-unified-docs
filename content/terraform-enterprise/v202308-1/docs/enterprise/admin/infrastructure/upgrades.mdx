# Upgrading

This section explains how to upgrade Terraform Enterprise to a new
version. [Learn more about availability during upgrades here](/terraform/enterprise/system-overview/reliability-availability#availability-during-upgrades).

## Before Upgrade

We strongly recommend the following:
 - Create a backup copy of the storage prior to upgrading your instance. Backup and restore responsibility varies depending on your Terraform Enterprise [operation mode](/terraform/enterprise/system-overview/reliability-availability#operation-modes).
 - Review the general [Terraform Enterprise requirements](/terraform/enterprise/requirements/credentials), including credentials, hardware, operating system, data storage, and network. 
 - Review the upgrade requirements and release notes for the specific [Terraform Enterprise release](/terraform/enterprise/releases).
 - Review the [Upgrading TFE or Patching TFE Node Instances](/terraform/enterprise/admin/infrastructure/admin-cli#upgrading-tfe-or-patching-tfe-node-instances) for your Terraform Enterprise active/active architecture. 

## Online

### Replicated Console

1. From the installer dashboard (`https://<TFE HOSTNAME>:8800/dashboard`),
   click the "Check Now" button. Terraform recognizes the new version.
1. Click "View Update".
1. Review the release notes and then click "Install Update".

### Replicated Command Line Interface

1. Connect to the Terraform Enterprise host machine using SSH.

1. Fetch the versions of Terraform Enterprise.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release ls --fetch
   ```

1. Upgrade to the latest version of Terraform Enterprise.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release apply
   ```

   Alternatively, upgrade to a specific version of Terraform Enterprise.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release apply --sequence "504"
   ```

## Airgapped

### Replicated Console

1. Determine the update path where the installer will look for new `.airgap`
   packages. You can do this from the console settings of your instance
   (`https://<TFE HOSTNAME>:8800/console/settings`) in the field `Update Path`.
1. Download the new `.airgap` package onto the instance and put it into the
   `Update Path` location.
1. From the installer dashboard (`https://<TFE HOSTNAME>:8800/dashboard`) click the
   "Check Now" button. Terraform recognizes the new version.
1. Click "View Update".
1. Review the release notes and then click "Install Update".

### Replicated Command Line Interface

1. Connect to the Terraform Enterprise host machine using SSH.

1. Print the `AirgapPackagePath`.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl params export --template '{{.AirgapPackagePath}}'
   ```

1. On the Terraform Enterprise host machine, upload the desired airgap packages into the `AirgapPackagePath`.

1. Fetch the versions of Terraform Enterprise from the uploaded airgap packages.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release ls --fetch
   ```

1. List the available versions of airgap packages for the upgrade.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release ls
   ```

1. Upgrade to the latest version of the available airgap packages.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release apply
   ```

   Alternatively, upgrade to a specific version, using one of the options listed in the output of the previous step.

   ```
   $ replicatedctl app-release apply --sequence "504"
   ```
