# Administration: GitHub App Integration

Site administrators can provision a GitHub App integration that can be used across all organizations on the same Terraform Enterprise instance.

GitHub App integrations offer advantages over integrating via GitHub OAuth. Refer to [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps) to learn more.


## Configuring GitHub App Integration

These instructions are for using repositories from GitHub.com or Self-hosted GitHub Enterprise with Terraform Enterprise.

For more information on using a GitHub App and GitHub Permissions in Terraform Cloud, see [GitHub Permissions in Terraform Cloud](/cloud-docs/vcs/github-app#github-permissions).

### Step 1: Configure GitHub App Settings in Terraform Enterprise

You can integrate with either GitHub.com or a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise instance.

1. Go to the admin interface and then click **VCS Integrations**. The **VCS Integrations** page appears.

2. Click **Create global GitHub App**. The **Location** and **GitHub App Owner** options appear.

3. For the **Location** option, choose if you want to integrate with **GitHub.com** or a **Self-hosted GitHub Enterprise** instance.

    - If integrating with a **Self-hosted GitHub Enterprise** instance, fill in the **HTTP URL** and **API URL** of your GitHub Enterprise instance.

    | Field    | Value                                       |
    | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | HTTP URL | `https://<GITHUB INSTANCE HOSTNAME>`        |
    | API URL  | `https://<GITHUB INSTANCE HOSTNAME>/api/v3` |

4. For the **GitHub App Owner**, choose either **Personal Account** or **Organization Account**.

    - If assigning ownership to a GitHub Organization, fill in the **Organization Name**.

    -> **Note**: You can change this later. See the [Transferring GitHub App Ownership](#transferring-github-app-ownership) section below for more information.

5. Click **Create global GitHub App**. You will be redirected to the **Create GitHub App** screen on GitHub.

6. Modify the default GitHub App name if necessary. When done, click **Create GitHub App for [GitHub User Handle]**.


-> **Note**: The GitHub App name must satisfy GitHub's requirements.

### Step 2: Authorize and Install the GitHub App

In order to start using your GitHub App, you must authorize and install it.

1. Click **Authorize**. The GitHub Authorization dialog appears.

2. Accept the authorization. Afterwards, the GitHub installation dialog will appear.

    -> **Note**: If the installation dialog fails to appear, make sure your browser settings allow pop-ups for your Terraform Enterprise site.

3. Select the repositories you want to grant access to.

-> **Note**: This will limit which GitHub repositories your workspaces, policy sets, and registry modules have access to.

### Finished

Your Global GitHub App for Terraform Enterprise is fully installed and configured. You can now create Terraform workspaces based on the GitHub repositories your Global GitHub App has access to.

### Transferring GitHub App Ownership

During the setup process for your GitHub App, you can choose a default owner for the application.

If you want to transfer ownership of the GitHub App to another user or organization, follow the [transferring GitHub App ownership](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app) instructions. No actions need to be taken within Terraform Enterprise.

### Removing Global GitHub App from Terraform Enterprise

~> **Warning**: Do not delete the GitHub App from GitHub until you have first removed it from Terraform Enterprise.

In order to remove the GitHub App from your Terraform Enterprise instance, you must first remove all installations for the application in GitHub.

#### Step 1: Remove GitHub App Installations

~> **Warning**: Uninstalling the application will remove the connections it has to workspaces, policy sets, and registry modules.

1. Go to the admin interface and then click **VCS Integrations**. The **VCS Integrations** page appears.

2. If you previously authorized the GitHub App, accessible installations will be shown. Otherwise, you will need to authorize the GitHub App to continue with the removal.

3. For each installation, click **View in GitHub**. A new tab will open showing the installation settings page within GitHub.

    -> **Note**: You can also find the list of **[Installed GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/installations)** on the **Applications** page in GitHub **Settings**.

4. Locate the **Danger zone** section.

5. Click **Uninstall** to uninstall the application. Repeat this process for each installation.

#### Step 2: Remove GitHub App from TFE


After you have removed all GitHub App installations, remove the GitHub App from Terraform Enterprise.

-> **Note**: You may need to refresh the **VCS Integrations** page to verify that all app installations have been removed.

1. Click the red delete button. A confirmation modal will appear.

7. In the confirmation modal, click **Delete**. A success message will appear and you will be navigated back to the admin interface home page.

3. You are now free to delete the GitHub App in GitHub.
