# Terraform Enterprise v202212-1 (665)

Last required release: [v202207-2 (642)](/enterprise/releases/2022/v202207-2)

## Known Issues

1. The Certificate Authority (CA) bundle is not injected into the `tfe-task-worker` container, resulting in x509 errors in Sentinel policies when connecting to HTTPS endpoints. This is fixed in Terraform Enterprise v202212-2.

1. The logging for some services (tfe-atlas and tfe-sidekiq) are set to `debug` causing an increase in logging output. This is corrected in v202301-2.
1. [Updated August 14, 2024] Runs that rely on dynamic provider credentials and workload identity will fail after a certain number of signing key rotations. This problem is fixed in v202407-1, and you can avoid it by upgrading v202407-1 or above. For details on additional workarounds, including manually trimming keys, refer to [our support article](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/31715716966419-Issue-with-OIDC-Vault-key-rotation-mechanism-to-incorrectly-identify-the-newest-signing-key).

## Highlights

1. The `tfe-nomad` container has been removed and replaced with a new `tfe-task-worker` container. The `tfe-task-worker` container is now responsible for running `sentinel`, `cost-estimation`, and `plan-exporter` tasks. Logs for these tasks can now be found in the `tfe-task-worker` container logs. This change is part of a larger effort to refresh the architecture of Terraform Enterprise, improve performance and reliability of runs, and support future application-level features.
1. A new `tfe-atlas-ui` container has been added to serve the Terraform Enterprise frontend and static assets.
1. Terraform Enterprise no longer starts when connected to an [unsupported PostgreSQL server version](/enterprise/requirements/data-storage/postgres-requirements) to prevent potential database incompatibility issues when upgrading. The entry `PostgreSQL version X does not meet PostgreSQL version requirements` will appear in the logs.
1. Terraform Enterprise now supports [Run tasks in the Pre-plan and Pre-apply](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks#associating-run-tasks-with-a-workspace) stages of a run. Run tasks are custom integrations that can send run data to external services. They can either produce warnings or stop runs, depending on your workspace settings.

## Features

1. For Terraform versions 1.2+, Terraform Enterprise hides data sources reads in the plan UI by default. Use the filter checkbox to show them when necessary.
1. The [List Workspaces API endpoint](/enterprise/api-docs/workspaces#list-workspaces) now supports wildcard matching. For example, searching with `search[wildcard-name]=*-prod` returns all workspaces ending in `-prod`.

## Improvements

1. Improved the performance of a data migration added in Terraform Enterprise v202207-1 for installations with large amounts of configuration versions.
1. You no longer need to confirm plans with no infrastructure changes that Terraform created with the `allow-empty-apply` option. You may want to use this option when you [upgrade your workspace's state](/enterprise/workspaces/state#upgrading-state) to a new Terraform version.
1. The users administration page now displays a warning next to accounts with an unconfirmed email address.

## Bug Fixes

1. Terraform Enterprise no longer occasionally fails to save outputs associated with a new state.
1. The `tfe-registry-worker` now consistently cleans up the temp disk space that it used during module ingress.
1. Using the the API to create a module version beginning with `v` no longer prevents the registry from displaying other module versions. Versions like `v1.0.3` previously caused failures.
1. You can now download Sentinel mocks for older Terraform runs.
1. When you cancel a Terraform run during the apply process, Terraform Enterprise now displays the resource state as `Unknown`. Previously, the UI showed a message incorrectly implying that Terraform was still attempting to complete the apply.
1. The VCS provider settings no longer displays a blank page for organizations with large numbers of VCS providers.
1. Failed attempts to reauthorize VCS providers no longer prevent new reauthorization workflows.
1. OAuth clients that the `tfe-provider` is managing can no longer start VCS provider reauthorization.
1. Public GitHub avatars will no longer be used for private provider logos when the namespace for the private provider matches a GitHub username.

## Security

1. Container updates address reported vulnerabilities (CVEs) in underlying packages and dependencies.
