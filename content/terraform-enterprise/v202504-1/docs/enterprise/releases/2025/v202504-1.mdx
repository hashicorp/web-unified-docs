# Terraform Enterprise v202504-1

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:99244574d5a2094144af82635c8ba83fd67de9762d3537e8db0ad52c118ff455`

## Highlights

1. You can now authenticate to the PostgreSQL server using client certificates.
2. You can now use the new `tfectl admin usage-report` cli command to manually generate product usage reports.

## Features

1. You can add a secondary hostname in Terraform Enterprise and specify whether to use the `primary` or `secondary` hostname for VCS and Run Task integrations.
1. You can now tag Terraform Enterprise projects, effectively tagging all of their child workspaces.
1. You can now use a key-value tagging scheme for Terraform Enterprise workspaces and projects.
1. You can now use reserved tag keys to standardize the tag keys used across your organization, or to disable the use of workspace-level overrides when administering tags at the project level.

## Improvements

1. The search box in the private module registry previously lost focus with each typed character, making it difficult to search for modules. This issue has been fixed, ensuring that the search box retains focus while typing.

## Bug Fixes

1. Terraform Enterprise now rotates the Nginx access log kept in the ephemeral filesystem.
1. Fix API error when attempting to unlock workspace after uploading state version larger than 512MB.
1. Support use of custom tool version URLs with runs.
