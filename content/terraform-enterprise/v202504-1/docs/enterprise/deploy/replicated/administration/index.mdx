# Administration for Replicated deployments overview

This topic contains overview information administrating the Terraform Enterprise host and infrastructure when deployed to the legacy Replicated runtime. For information about administration for non-Replicated runtimes, including Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, OpenShift, and Podman, refer to [Manage Terraform Enterprise deployment overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage). 

## Workflows

Installing and managing a Terraform Enterprise involves administering both the [application](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration) itself and the infrastructure behind that application. 

You can perform the following actions:

- [Manage your HashiCorp license](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/license)
- [Manage your infrastructure](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure)
