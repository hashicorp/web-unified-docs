## Workflows

1. [Perform diagnistics](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/perform-diagnostics), such as checking service health status and logs and enabling debug mode on Kubernetes. 
1. Refer to the [error messages reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/error-messages) for information about the errors Terraform Enterprise prints and steps to resolve them.
