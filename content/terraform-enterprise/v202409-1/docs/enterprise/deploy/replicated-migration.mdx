# Migrate from Replicated to another runtime

This topic describes how to migrate Terraform Enterprise instances from Replicated to another runtime environment. 

## Overview

The target runtime must host instances on the same version of Terraform Enterprise as the instances hosted in Replicated. You cannot combine an application upgrade and migration. Upgrade your current installation of Terraform Enterprise to the latest version before proceeding with your migration. Use the same procedure to migrate from Replicated to all other supported runtimes:

1. Back up your Terraform Enterprise data tier, which includes the PostgreSQL database and object storage.
1. Upgrade your existing Replicated installation to `v202309-1` or later. 
1. Deploy the same version Terraform Enterprise to your new runtime.
1. Migrate your data tier to your new installation.

The migration paths are specific to the [operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) of your existing Terraform Enterprise installation and the runtime environment you want to migrate to.

- Docker:

   - [Migrating using mounted disk operational mode to Docker runtime](#mounted-disk-to-docker)
   - [Migrating using external services operational mode to Docker runtime](#external-services-to-docker)

- Kubernetes

   - [Migrating using mounted disk to Cloud-managed Kubernetes](#mounted-disk-to-cloud-managed-kubernetes)
   - [Migrating using external services or Active/Active to Cloud-managed Kubernetes](#external-services-or-active-active-to-cloud-managed-kubernetes)

- Podman
   - The procedure for [migrating to Podman](#migrate-to-podman) is the same for `disk` and `external` operational modes.

- Nomad
   - [Migrating using mounted disk to Nomad](#mounted-disk-to-nomad)
   - [Migrating using external services or Active/Active to Nomad](#external-services-or-active-active-to-nomad)



## Prerequisites

### Back up data tier

1. We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting maintenance or upgrade operations. The backup method will depend on your existing installation.

   - For mounted disk installations, refer to [Backup a Mounted Disk Deployment](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#backup-a-mounted-disk-deployment) in the Terraform Enterprise backup tutorial for recommended patterns.
   - For external services or active active installations, refer to [Object Store](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#object-store) and [Database](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#database) in the Terraform Enterprise backup tutorial for recommended patterns.

   In both cases, we recommend backing up the environment variables of the Terraform Enterprise Docker container so that you can refer to them when configuring your target runtime.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker exec terraform-enterprise env > env.txt
   ```

### Upgrade your existing Terraform Enterprise installation

1. [Upgrade your Replicated-hosted Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades) installation to [v202309-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202309-1) or later.
1. Run the following commands to validate that the upgrade completed successfully:
   1. Validate the release version.
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app inspect
      ```
   1. Check that Replicated has started.
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app status
      ```
   1. Check that the docker containers are up.
      ```shell-session
      $ sudo docker ps
      ```
   1. Do a health check.
      ```shell-session
      $ tfe-admin health-check
      ```
   1. Do a `terraform plan` and a `terraform apply`.

## Mounted disk to Docker

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

If at any point you need to revert your settings, see [the rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated-migration#mounted-disk-rollback-steps).

### Migration steps

#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. See the backup data guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for a detailed
guide on how to move forward with the backup process.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Terraform Enterprise

Upgrade your Replicated-hosted Terraform Enterprise installation to [v202309-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202309-1) or later. Refer to [Upgrading](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades)
for instructions.

#### Step 3: Verify Docker Engine version

Docker should already be installed for you because Replicated is installed on this host. You may still need to install Docker Compose if you have not already.
Refer to [Docker Engine Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/requirements/docker_engine) for more information.

If you cannot upgrade Docker Engine or install in a supported Docker configuration then install and migrate Terraform Enterprise to a different runtime.

#### Step 4: Generate Docker Compose configuration

To convert your existing configuration into a Docker Compose format on your current Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated), follow these steps:
1. Create a `/etc/terraform-enterprise` directory.
1. Generate the Docker Compose configuration and save it to `/etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml` using the following command:
```shell-session
sudo docker exec terraform-enterprise tfectl app config --format docker > /etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml
```
Your saved output should resemble the configuration file in [the example `disk` mode configuration](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker#example-disk-mode-configuration).

#### Step 5: Prepare the host and install

To make migration smoother and faster, we recommend using the same host as your current Replicated instance.

-> **Note**: If you want to use a separate host for your new docker-based Terraform Enterprise, we can provide alternative steps. [Reach out to support for assistance](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/contact-support).

1. Review the configuration file from the previous step. Update any values as needed before moving on to the next step. Pay special attention to placeholder values enclosed in `<>`, such as `image` and `TFE_LICENSE`, and replace them with your actual values.

   Alternatively, you can use the [mounted disk example](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker#example-disk-mode-configuration) as a starting point and adjust it to fit your environment.

   Note that the volumes `type` fields are set to `bind` for the `tfe` service. You can source many of your required values from the Replicated application configuration backup you created earlier. For a comprehensive list of configuration settings, refer to the [Configuration Reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration).

1. Log in to the Terraform Enterprise container image registry.

   ```shell-session
   $ cat <PATH_TO_HASHICORP_LICENSE_FILE> |  docker login --username terraform images.releases.hashicorp.com --password-stdin
   ```

1. Pull the Terraform Enterprise image from the registry.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker pull images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
   ```

1. Create a new `systemd` service for Terraform Enterprise by creating a `/etc/systemd/system/terraform-enterprise.service` file with [the contents on the Docker Installation guide](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker). Update this systemd unit file if any of the following are true:

   - The name or the path of the `docker-compose.yml` has changed.
   - The path to the Docker binary and the command to invoke `docker compose` is different because Docker Engine 1.13.1 is installed.

#### Step 6: Stop Replicated and migrate

Next, you can stop Replicated and migrate your Terraform Enterprise installation to Docker.

1. SSH into your Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) instance.
1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```
1. Back up your data. If you have already backed up your data proceed forward. If not, or if you want another backup for safe keeping, do the following.
   - Retrieve your mounted disk path.

      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .disk_path.Value }}' | tr -d '\r'
      ```

   - We will refer to this path as the `${DISK_PATH}` going forward. Next, archive your mounted disk data.

      ```shell-session
      $ tar -zcvf data.tar.gz -C ${DISK_PATH} aux postgres
      ```
   - Copy your `data.tar.gz` archive to a safe place.

1. Start (and enable on start up) the Docker Compose based Terraform Enterprise.

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```

1. Check the status of your service with `systemctl status terraform-enterprise`, or use `docker ps` to find your container's name then run `docker logs [name]`. You can also run `curl https://[hostname]/_health_check` to check the health check endpoint. Terraform Enterprise should now be running using Docker Compose, so your Replicated services can be shut down and disabled.

1. Shut down Replicated.

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```

1. Next, stop and remove the unnecessary Replicated containers.
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-premkit
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-statsd
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
   ```

-> **Note**: some of the `docker stop` commands may return “Container not found” errors because not every Replicated install has every container.

#### Step 7: Validate migration success

Finally, test that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, you can use those instead of doing the following steps.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Mounted Disk rollback steps

In the unlikely event you encounter issues and need to roll back, you can revert back to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) using the following commands.

1. Stop and disable Terraform Enterprise (Docker).
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Start and enable Replicated.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```
1. Start Terraform Enterprise (Replicated)
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## External services to Docker

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

If at any point you need to revert your settings, see [the rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated-migration#external-services-rollback-steps).

### Migration steps

#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. See the backup data guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for a detailed
guide on how to move forward with the backup process.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Terraform Enterprise

Upgrade your Replicated-hosted Terraform Enterprise installation to [v202309-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202309-1) or later. Refer to [Upgrading](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades)
for instructions.

#### Step 3: Verify Docker engine version

Docker should already be installed for you because Replicated is installed on this host. You may still need to install Docker Compose if you have not already.
See the [Docker Engine Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/requirements/docker_engine) for more information.

If you cannot upgrade Docker Engine or install in a supported Docker configuration then install and migrate Terraform Enterprise to a different runtime.

#### Step 4: Generate Docker Compose configuration

To convert your existing configuration into a Docker Compose format on your current Terraform Enterprise installation (Replicated), follow these steps:
1. Create a directory at `/etc/terraform-enterprise`.

1. Generate the Docker Compose configuration and save it to `/etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml` using the following command:
   ```shell-session
   sudo docker exec terraform-enterprise tfectl app config --format docker > /etc/terraform-enterprise/docker-compose.yml
   ```
   Your saved output should resemble the configuration file in [our external services example](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker#example-external-mode-configuration).

#### Step 5: Prepare the host and install

To make migration smoother and faster, we recommend using the same host as your current Replicated instance.

-> **Note**: If you want to use a separate host for your new docker-based Terraform Enterprise, we can provide alternative steps. [Reach out to support for assistance](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/contact-support).

1. Complete the instructions for creating and applying TLS certificates. Refer to [Create TLS certificates](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/prepare-host#create-tls-certificates) and [Set up installation folders and files](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker#set-up-installation-folders-and-files) for instructions.
1. Review the configuration file from previous step. Update any values as needed before moving on to the next step. Pay special attention to placeholder values enclosed in `<>`, such as `image` and `TFE_LICENSE`, and replace them with your actual values.

   Alternatively, you can use the [external services installation instructions for Docker deployments](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker#example-external-mode-configuration) as a starting point and adjust it to fit your environment.

   Update, verify, and remove any unsuitable configuration variables that don't match the reality of your current Terraform Enterprise deployment. For a comprehensive list of available configuration settings, refer to the [Configuration Reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration).

   To quickly identify many of the required configuration values, inspect the existing Terraform Enterprise application using the `replicatedctl app-config export` command.

1. Log into the registry and then use the `docker` command to pull the `terraform-enterprise` image version.

   ```shell-session
   $ cat <PATH_TO_HASHICORP_LICENSE_FILE> | docker login --username terraform images.releases.hashicorp.com --password-stdin
   ```

   When prompted for a password, use the contents of your HashiCorp license file as your password.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker pull images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
   ```

1. Optionally create a new systemd service for Terraform Enterprise. Refer to [Manage the Docker service](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/docker#manage-the-docker-service) for instructions.

   -> **Note**: If you want to use a separate host for your new Docker-based Terraform Enterprise deployment, [contact HashiCorp support](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/contact-support) for assistance.

#### Step 6: Stop Replicated and migrate

Next, you can stop Replicated and migrate your Terraform Enterprise installation to Docker.

1. SSH into your Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) instance.
1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding.

   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```
1. Start (and enable on start up) the Docker Compose based Terraform Enterprise.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Check the status of your service with `systemctl status terraform-enterprise`, or use `docker ps` to find your container's name then run `docker logs [name]`.

   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-statsd
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
   ```

-> **Note**: Some of the `docker stop` commands may return “Container not found” errors because not every Replicated install has every container.

#### Step 7: Validate migration success

Finally, test that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, f those instead of doing the following steps.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### External Services rollback steps

In the unlikely event you encounter issues and need to roll back, you can revert back to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) using the following commands.

1. Stop and disable Terraform Enterprise (Docker).
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now terraform-enterprise
   ```
1. Start and enable Replicated.
   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl enable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```
1. Start Terraform Enterprise (Replicated)
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## Mounted disk to Cloud-managed Kubernetes

You must provide an external PostgreSQL database server, external object storage, and external Redis storage. Refer to the [prerequisites for deploying to Kubernetes](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/kubernetes#prerequisites) for additional information. 

If you currently use the [mounted disk operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/operational-modes#operational-modes) for Terraform Enterprise on Replicated, you do not meet the above requirements.
You must first [migrate to external services mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/mounted-to-external-migration), and then follow the external services to Kubernetes migration guide as well as deploy an external Redis server.
At a high level, this process involves:

1. [Backing up your data](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#backup-a-mounted-disk-deployment).
1. [Restoring your data to external services](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-recovery).
1. Testing that the external services migration succeeded.
1. Deploying external redis.
1. Follow the guide for [External Services to Kubernetes migration](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/replicated-migration#external-services-or-active-active-to-cloud-managed-kubernetes).

Contact your HashiCorp account representative or HashiCorp support if you have additional questions.

## External services or Active/Active to Cloud-managed Kubernetes

Redis is a _required service_ for running Terraform Enterprise in Kubernetes. If your deployment is in operating in [`external` mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#external), you must deploy an external Redis server.

If you are currently operating Terraform Enterprise in `active-active` mode, then you have all required service dependencies for migrating to Kubernetes. Refer to the [prerequisites for deploying to Kubernetes](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/kubernetes#prerequisites) for additional information.

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

If at any point you need to revert your settings, see [the rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated-migration#kubernetes-rollback-steps).

### Migration steps

#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

We always recommend backing up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. See the backup data guide under the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for a detailed
guide on how to move forward with the backup process.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Terraform Enterprise

Upgrade your Replicated-hosted Terraform Enterprise installation to [v202309-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202309-1) or later. Refer to [Upgrading](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades)
for instructions.

#### Step 1: Prepare the custom Helm Values file for Terraform Enterprise

1. On Terraform Enterprise (Replicated), view existing configuration:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app-config export
   ```

1. Create a custom [Helm Values file](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) e.g `overrides.yaml` to override the [default values](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/blob/main/values.yaml) in the [Terraform Enterprise Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/tree/main).

1. On the `env.secrets` and `env.variables` sections of the [overrides values file](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/blob/main/values.yaml), use the external services credentials from the Replicated installation for the Kubernetes installation. Specifically the following:
   1. The `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_TYPE` and `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_*` variables should specify the object storage type and the container or bucket credentials from your Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_DATABASE_*` variables should specify database credentials from the Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_REDIS_*` values on the Helm chart should specify the same credentials from the external Redis in your Replicated installation.
   1. If there is an external vault, the `TFE_VAULT_*` values on the Helm chart should specify the same credentials from the external Vault in your Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` value should match the Replicated installation value. You can get this from your Replicated instance via SSH by running the following command:
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .enc_password.Value }}'
      ```
      Refer to the [Replicated to flexible deployments configuration mapping](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#replicated-to-flexible-deployments-configuration-mapping) for more information on how the Replicated configuration maps to the variables and secrets on Terraform Enterprise Helm chart.

      Refer to the [example Kubernetes configuration](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/kubernetes#examples) for additional reference information about cloud-specific override values for the Helm deployment.

#### Step 2: Migrate to Kubernetes

1. Stop your Replicated installation by executing the following command:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```

1. Wait for the application to stop:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app status
   ```

1. [Install Terraform Enterprise on Kubernetes using Helm](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/kubernetes).

#### Step 3: Validate migration success

Finally, test that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, you can use those instead of doing the following steps. You should
be able to log in to your new Terraform Enterprise installation with the credentials previously used for your Replicated installation.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Kubernetes rollback steps

In the unlikely event you encounter issues that cannot be worked around, you can rollback to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated).

1. If it is possible to `exec` into the pods, run the `node drain` command to stop Terraform Enterprise from executing further instructions.

   ```shell-session
   $ tfectl node drain --all
   ```

1. Uninstall the deployment.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm uninstall terraform-enterprise
   ```

1. Restart Terraform Enterprise on Replicated using the same external services.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## Migrate to Podman

Before proceeding with this migration guide, make sure you meet all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that a Flexible
Deployment Options license file has been provided by your HashiCorp business partner.
Do not proceed with this guide if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

Complete the following steps to migrate from Replicated to Podman.

The minimum Terraform Enterprise version necessary for Podman is [v202404-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202404-1).

#### Step 1: Prepare the host

We recommend deploying Terraform Enterprise to the same host as your current Replicated instance.

[Contact HashiCorp support](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/contact-support) for assistance migrating your Terraform Enterprise installation to a separate host.

1. We recommend reusing your Replicated certificate to minimize the upgrade's effect on your other stack components.

   Create a directory with the following:

   - TLS certificate (`cert.pem`)
   - TLS private key (`key.pem`)
   - CA certificates bundle (`bundle.pem`)

   If you do not have a CA certificates bundle, place your TLS certificate (`cert.pem`) inside `bundle.pem` instead.
   Add your certificates to a folder on your host.

   If you cannot access your certificate, key, or bundle file, you can retrieve them from the Replicated Terraform Enterprise container. Run the following command to list the certificate paths in the container:

   ```sh
   docker exec terraform-enterprise tfectl app config --unredacted | jq '{cert: .tls.cert_file, key: .tls.key_file, bundle: .tls.ca_bundle_file}'
   ```

   Depending on your setup, the file paths may differ from the following example output:

   ```sh
   {
   "cert": "/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/cert.pem",
   "key": "/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/key.pem",
   "bundle": "/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/bundle.pem"
   }
   ```

   You can then copy the files from the container into the host.

   ```sh
   docker cp terraform-enterprise:/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/cert.pem <PATH_TO_CERTS_ON_HOST>/cert.pem
   docker cp terraform-enterprise:/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/key.pem <PATH_TO_CERTS_ON_HOST>/key.pem
   docker cp terraform-enterprise:/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/bundle.pem <PATH_TO_CERTS_ON_HOST>/bundle.pem
   ```

1. Next, backup your Replicated configuration.
   Your Replicated configuration contains necessary information, such as the `<TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD>` as `enc_password` and the `<MOUNTED_DISK_PATH>` as `disk_path`.

   ```
   replicatedctl app-config export > replicated-app-config.backup.json
   ```

1. Create a yaml file based on the template for your current operational mode: 
     - [Mounted Disk operational mode Kubernetes YAML example](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/podman#example-disk-mode-configuration).
     - [External operational mode Kubernetes YAML example](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/podman#example-external-mode-configuration).
     - [Active/Active operational mode Kubernetes YAML example](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/podman#example-active-active-mode-configuration).

   Replace the values enclosed in `<>` with your installation's values. For example, set `TFE_HOSTNAME` to the DNS hostname you use to access Terraform Enterprise.

#### Step 2: Stop Terraform Enterprise and remove Replicated

Replicated runs using `docker`, while Podman uses `podman-docker`. Installing Podman removes docker, which is why we recommend backing up your data before stopping your Terraform Enterprise instance. Ensure you have [backed up your data](#step-1-backup-your-data-tier-3) and [Replicated configuration](#step-3-prepare-the-host) before proceeding.

1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding.

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```

1. Shut down Replicated.

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl disable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
   ```

1. Next, stop and clean up your unnecessary Replicated containers.
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-premkit
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker stop replicated-statsd
   ```
   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
   ```

#### Step 3: Install Podman

Verify that you have met the [prerequisites for deploying to Podman](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/podman#prerequisites) before installing Terraform Enterprise on Podman.
Follow the [Podman installation guide](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/podman).

#### Step 4: Download and install image

1.  Log into the Terraform Enterprise container image registry using `terraform`
    as the username and your HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise license as the password:

    ```shell-session
    $ echo "<HASHICORP_LICENSE>" |  podman login --username terraform images.releases.hashicorp.com --password-stdin
    ```

1.  Pull the Terraform Enterprise image from the registry.

    ```shell-session
    $ podman pull images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
    ```

#### Step 5: Start a Terraform pod

1.  Create a Terraform Enterprise pod by running the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman play kube <path_to_YAML_file>
    ```

1.  In a separate terminal session, you can monitor the logs by running the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman logs -f <container_name>
    ```

1.  Monitor the health of the application until it starts reporting healthy with the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ podman exec <container_name> tfe-health-check-status
    ```

#### Step 6: Validate migration success

Complete the following steps to verify that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works as expected. Alternatively, you can execute your existing suite of release acceptance tests.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI to test several subsystems. This step ensures that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and that the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from version control to test that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation policies enabled. This step ensures that run tasks and cost estimation function as expected.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool to verify that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Mounted Disk rollback steps

Complete the following steps to revert to a Replicated deployment.

1. Stop Terraform Enterprise on Podman.

   ```shell-session
   $ podman play kube <path_to_YAML_file> --down
   ```

2. Remove Podman.

   ```shell-session
   $ dnf module remove -y container-tools
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ dnf remove -y podman-docker
   ```

3. Install Terraform Enterprise on Replicated.

   If available, you can reuse the instance initialization script to reinstall Terraform Enterprise on Replicated. Otherwise, refer to the [Replicated installation guide](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/install/interactive/installer#installation).

## Mounted disk to Nomad

You must provide an external PostgreSQL database server, external object storage, and external Redis storage. Refer to the [prerequisites for deploying to Nomad](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/nomad#prerequisites) for additional information. 

You must complete additional steps to migrate a Terraform Enterprise deployment on Replicated in [`disk` mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/storage/configure-mode): 

1. [Migrate your Replicated deployment to `external` mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/mounted-to-external-migration) 
1. Verify that the migration succeeded.
1. Deploy an external Redis server.

You can then complete the steps for migrating to Nomad in `external` mode:

1. Back up your data. Refer to the [Backup a Mounted Disk Deployment](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#backup-a-mounted-disk-deployment) for instructions.
1. Restore your data to external services. Refer to the [Terraform Enterprise recovery and restore - recommended pattern](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-recovery) tutorial for instructions.
1. Verify that the external services migration succeeded.
1. Complete the steps for migrating to Nomad in `external` mode. Refer to [External Services to Nomad migration](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated-migration#external-services-or-active-active-to-nomad) for instructions.

Contact your HashiCorp account representative or HashiCorp support if you have additional questions.

## External services or Active/Active to Nomad

Redis is required to run Terraform Enterprise in Nomad. If you are migrating a Replicated deployment in [`external` operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/operational-modes#operational-modes), you need to deploy an external Redis server.

If you are migrating a Replicated deployment in `active-active` operational mode, you should already have all the required service dependencies. Refer to the [prerequisites for deploying to Nomad](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/nomad#prerequisites) for additional information.

Before proceeding, verify that you meet the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and that you have a Terraform Enterprise license file. Do not continue if any of the prerequisites are not fulfilled.

If you need to revert at any point, refer to [Nomad rollback steps](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated-migration#nomad-rollback-steps) for instructions.

### Migration steps
Complete the following steps to perform the migration.
#### Step 1: Backup your data tier

Back up your data tier before conducting any maintenance or migration. Refer to [Back up data tier](#back-up-data-tier) for instructions.

#### Step 2: Upgrade to a compatible version of Terraform Enterprise

The existing version of Terraform Enterprise must be able to run on non-Replicated runtimes. Refer to [Upgrade existing Terraform Enterprise installation to a compatible version](#upgrade-existing-terraform-enterprise-installation-to-a-flexible-deployment-options-compatible-version) for upgrade instructions.
#### Step 3: Prepare the Nomad job file for Terraform Enterprise

1. Run the following command to view existing configuration:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app-config export
   ```

1. Create a Nomad job file for Terraform Enterprise. Refer to [Configure Terraform Enterprise Nomad job specification](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/nomad#configure-terraform-enterprise-nomad-job-specification) for additional information.

1. In the Terraform Enterprise Nomad job specification, specify the following values:
   1. The `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_TYPE` and `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_*` variables should specify the object storage type and the container or bucket credentials from your Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_DATABASE_*` variables should specify database credentials from the Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_REDIS_*` values on the Helm chart should specify the same credentials from the external Redis in your Replicated installation.
   1. If Terraform Enterprise is connected to an external Vault server, the `TFE_VAULT_*` values on the Helm chart should specify the same credentials from the external Vault in your Replicated installation.
   1. The `TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` value should match the Replicated installation value. You can get this from your Replicated instance by connecting to the instance over SSH and running the following command:
      ```shell-session
      $ replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .enc_password.Value }}'
      ```
      Refer to the [Replicated to flexible deployments configuration mapping](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#replicated-to-flexible-deployments-configuration-mapping) for details about the configurations.

#### Step 4: Migrate to Nomad

1. Stop your Replicated installation by executing the following command:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app stop
   ```

1. Wait for the application to stop:

   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app status
   ```

1. Install Terraform Enterprise on Nomad. Refer to [Deply Terraform Enterprise to Nomad](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/nomad) for instructions.

#### Step 5: Validate migration success

Verify that your new Terraform Enterprise installation works properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, you can use them instead of completing the following steps. You should
be able to log in to your new Terraform Enterprise installation with the credentials previously used for your Replicated installation.

1. Execute a plan and apply it from the CLI, testing several subsystems. Ensuring that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured, and the instance can download Terraform binaries and execute runs.
1. Execute a plan and apply it from VCS, testing that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides.
1. Publish a new module to the private module registry.
1. Execute a plan and apply it with a module or provider from the private registry to ensure the registry is functioning.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it with Sentinel and cost estimation, ensuring run tasks and cost estimation work.
1. (_Optional_) Execute a plan and apply it on a workspace that uses an agent pool, testing that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully.

#### Nomad rollback steps

Complete the following steps if an unresolvable issue emerges:

1. If you are able to connect to a job allocation using the [`nomad alloc exec`](/nomad/docs/commands/alloc/exec) command, run the `node drain` command to stop Terraform Enterprise from executing further instructions.

   ```shell-session
   $ tfectl node drain --all
   ```

1. Stop Terraform Enterprise job and purge it.

   ```shell-session
   $ nomad job stop -purge -namespace=$namespace <terraform enterprise job name>
   ```

1. Optionally, cleanup Nomad variables, ACLs, and namespaces.

   ```shell-session
   $ nomad var purge -namespace=$namespace <path to Nomad variables used by Terraform Enterprise job>
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ nomad acl policy delete -namespace=$namespace <policy name>
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ nomad namespace delete -force $namespace
   ```

1. Restart Terraform Enterprise on Replicated using the same external services.
   ```shell-session
   $ replicatedctl app start
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the following documentation to ensure you have uninterrupted visibility into the health of the application:

- [Startup checks reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/startup-checks)

- [Monitor Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor)

- [Metrics reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/metrics)

### Common Issues

Below are a list of common migration issues and symptoms of those issues.

#### Self signed certificates CA not in CA bundle

##### Symptoms:

- Plans fail
- Errors in `/var/log/terraform-enterprise/task-worker.log` and `/var/log/terraform-enterprise/atlas.log`, particularly when making calls to Archivist, where the certificate is from an unknown issuer.

##### Fix:

- Bring the additional certificates from the full chain certificate into the CA bundle
- Note that this action is partially automated when deploying to Replicated. For other runtimes, you may need to manually concatenate the certificates from the full chain certificate into the CA bundle for the instance to talk to itself.

#### Required CA not in CA bundle

##### Symptom:

- Setting up VCS fails with unknown certificate issuer error

##### Fix:

- Include the CA in the CA Bundle

#### Internal calls to instance or AWS Metadata Endpoint unnecessarily proxied

##### Symptom:

- Plans May fail, Logs may fail to load (but not always)
- The proxy directs traffic unexpectedly

##### Fix:

- When deployed to Replicated, Terraform builds much of the default `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` address list, but you are responsible for managing the list when deploying to the other supported runtimes. In addition to manually adding the entries from your Replicated `Additional No Proxy List` configuration, add the following entries to the `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` address list:
  - `localhost`
  - `127.0.0.1`
  - `169.254.169.254`
  - FQDN of instance
  - Rest of `no_proxy` list
