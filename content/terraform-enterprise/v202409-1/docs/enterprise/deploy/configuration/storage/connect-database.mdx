# Configure external PostgreSQL connection

This topic describes how to configure Terraform Enterprise to connect to an external PostgreSQL database. You only need to complete this task to operate Terraform Enterprise in `active-active` or `external` mode, which instructs Terraform Enterprise to store and retrieve data in an externally-managed database. If you prefer to allow Terraform Enterprise to manage the database, configure Terraform Enterprise to run in `disk` mode. Refer to [Configure operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for additional information.


## Introduction

Terraform Enterprise stores stateful application data, such as, workspace settings, organization settings, run information, and user information in a PostgreSQL database. Complete the following steps to configure Terraform Enterprise to store and retrieve the data in an externally-managed PostgreSQL database:

1. Prepare the PostgreSQL server to host the data. Preparation includes creating a user appropriate permissions and creating the extensions in the database.   
1. Specify the connection settings in your deployment configuration. If your server requires additional connection parameters, you must also specify them in the configuration. 

## Requirements

Before proceeding, verify that you meet the following requirements.

### Server

One of the following servers is required:

- PostgreSQL server, such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, version 12.x, 13.x, 14.4 and up, or 15.x.

  Note that PostgreSQL v12 will reach end of life on November 12, 2024. As a result, Terraform Enterprise will no longer v12 after that date.

- PostgreSQL-compatible server, such as Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.


### User

Create a PostgreSQL user with the following permissions on the database:

- Permissions to create, modify, and read all tables and indices on all schemas within the database. Database owners commonly have these permissions.
- Permissions to create extensions. If you are unable to create a user with the `CREATE EXTENSION` privilege, refer to [Create extensions](#create-extensions) for instructions on creating the necessary extensions.

## Create extensions

Create extensions for the `rails`, `vault`, `registry`, and `task_worker` PostgreSQL schemas. The database server automatically creates these schemas if they do not already exist.

Run the following commands on the PostgreSQL server to create the extensions:

```shell-session
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "hstore" WITH SCHEMA "rails";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" WITH SCHEMA "rails";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "citext" WITH SCHEMA "registry";
```

## Specify PostgreSQL connection settings

Add the following settings to your Terraform Enterprise configuration:

- Set the `TFE_DATABASE_HOST` variable to the location of your PostgreSQL server. Format the location as `HOST[:PORT]`, for example `db.example.com` or `db.example.com:5432`.
- Set the `TFE_DATABASE_NAME` variable to the name of the database you want to store the data in.
- Set the `TFE_DATABASE_USER` variable to the user name you want to use to access the database.
- Set the `TFE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` variable to the password for the user.

Refer to [Database settings](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#database-settings) in the configuration reference for additional information.   

### Additional connection parameters

Add the `TFE_DATABASE_PARAMETERS` variable to your configuration and specify any additional connection parameters necessary to connect to the server.

#### `sslmode`

When providing extra keyword parameters for the database connection, the `sslmode` parameter only allows the following values: 
- `require` 
- `verify-full`
- `verify-ca`
-  `disable`  

When operating Terraform Enterprise in `external` mode, the `sslmode` parameter is set to `require` by default.
When operating Terraform Enterprise in `disk` mode, the `sslmode` parameter is set to `disable` by default.

Terraform Enterprise provides a certificates file at `/etc/ssl/private/terraform-enterprise/bundle.pem`, which is required by the `verify-full` and `verify-ca` modes. 

Refer to the [PostgreSQL library documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-ssl.html) for additional information about using `sslmode`.

#### Client certificate configuration

Terraform Enterprise does not support PostgreSQL client certificates configuration due to the limitation of storing certificate files for the `sslcert` and `sslkey` connection parameters. Refer to [Client Certificates](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-CLIENTCERT) in the PostgreSQL documentation for additional information.
