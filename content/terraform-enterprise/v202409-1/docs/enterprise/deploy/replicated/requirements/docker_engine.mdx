# Docker Engine Requirements

This topic describes the Docker engine requirements for deploy Terraform Enterprise to Replicated. For information about deploying Terraform Enterprise natively to Docker using Docker Compose, refer to [Terraform Enterprise deployment overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy). Deploying to Docker natively is faster than Replicated deployments and results in faster startups, reduced resource requirements, and improved security.


Terraform Enterprise requires **at least one** of the following Docker Engine configurations, in order of preference:
  
  1. Docker Engine 23.x - 25.x

!> **Compatibility warning**: Terraform Enterprise does not yet support the pre-installed Docker version that comes with Amazon Linux 2023. You must uninstall your Docker version and manually install Docker Engine 24.x to ensure compatibility with Terraform Enterprise.
  
Docker v20.10 is *only* supported on Amazon Linux 2. Docker v20.10 is no longer receiving updates from Docker, including security updates. Customers using Amazon Linux 2 are encouraged to move to an operating system that supports Docker 23 or 24. In order run Docker v20.10, you will need *one* of the following:

  1. [`runc` v1.0.0-rc93 or greater](#docker-engine-with-a-compatible-runc-version)
  1. [`libseccomp` 2.4.4 or greater](#docker-engine-with-a-compatible-libseccomp-version)
  1. A [modified `libseccomp` profile](#docker-engine-using-a-modified-libseccomp-profile)
  
New online installations of Terraform Enterprise install a supported version of Docker Engine by default. Alternatively, you can install Docker Engine manually as long as you adhere to the above requirements.
  
Upgrades to Terraform Enterprise do not upgrade Docker Engine. It is your responsibility to keep Docker Engine up to date within these requirements to ensure stability and security.

## Docker Compose Compatibility

  Docker Engine comes prepackaged with Docker Compose and compatibility is assessed by meeting the Docker Engine requirements.  
  
  ```sh
  # Docker Engine 24.0 
  docker compose version
  ```
  

## Docker Engine With a Compatible `runc` Version

  1. [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) a supported Docker Engine version.
  
  1. Install the latest version of `containerd` for your operating system.
  
  On Debian/Ubuntu:
  
  ```sh
  sudo apt install containerd
  ```
  
  On RHEL/CentOS:
  
  ```sh
  sudo yum install containerd.io
  ```
  
  1. Confirm that the installed `containerd` version is 1.4.9, 1.5.5, or greater.
  
  ```sh
  containerd --version
  ```
  
  1. Confirm that the installed `runc` version is v1.0.0-rc93 or greater:
  
  ```sh
  runc --version
  ```
  
  1. If your Docker Engine and `runc` versions meet the requirements from previous steps, your system is properly configured. Otherwise, proceed to [  option 2](#option-2-docker-engine-with-a-compatible-libseccomp-version).

## Docker Engine With a Compatible `libseccomp` Version

  -> **Note:** These instructions should only be used if your operating system does not meet the requirements detailed in [Docker Engine With a Compatible `runc` Version](#docker-engine-with-a-compatible-runc-version).

  1. [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) a supported Docker Engine version.
  
  1. Install the latest version of `libseccomp` for your operating system.
  
  On Debian/Ubuntu:
  
  ```sh
  sudo apt install libseccomp2
  ```
  
  On RHEL/CentOS:
  
  ```sh
  sudo yum install libseccomp
  ```
  
  1. Confirm that the installed `libseccomp` version is 2.4.4 or greater.
  
  ```sh
  runc --version
  ```
  
  1. If your Docker Engine and `libseccomp` versions meet the requirements from previous steps, your system is properly configured. Otherwise,   proceed to [option 3](#option-3-docker-engine-using-a-modified-libseccomp-profile).

## Docker Engine Using a Modified `libseccomp` Profile

  -> **Note:** These instructions should only be used if your operating system does not meet the requirements detailed in either [Docker Engine With   a Compatible `runc` Version](#docker-engine-with-a-compatible-runc-version) or [Docker Engine With a Compatible `libseccomp`   Version](https://terraform.io/docker-engine-with-a-compatible-libseccomp-version).
  
  1. [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) a supported Docker Engine version.
  
  1. Check if the file `/etc/docker/seccomp.json` exists. If it does, proceed to step 4.
  
  1. Download the [default moby `libseccomp` profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json) and save it   to the file `/etc/docker/seccomp.json`.
  
  ```sh
  sudo curl -L -o /etc/docker/seccomp.json \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json
  ```
  
  1. In the `/etc/docker/seccomp.json` file, change `"defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",` to `"defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_TRACE",`.
  
  ```sh
  sudo sed -i 's/"defaultAction":\s*"SCMP_ACT_ERRNO"/"defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_TRACE"/1' /etc/docker/seccomp.json
  ```
