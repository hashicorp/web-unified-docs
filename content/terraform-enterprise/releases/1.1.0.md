## Known Issues

## Breaking Changes

## Deprecations
PostgreSQL 13 is [going end-of-life](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) in November. We are deprecating support for PostgreSQL 13 in this release, and we will remove support in the 1.2.0 release.

## Highlights
PostgreSQL 17, Google Cloud AlloyDB 16, and EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 and 17 databases are now officially supported.

## Features

## Improvements

1. Terraform Enterprise will now attempt to read and write from blob storage as a startup check, prior to running database migrations. -- **@p0pr0ck5** [terraform-enterprise#3224](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise/pull/3224)
1. Terraform Enterprise's database access in [automated product usage reporting](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/product-report) has been optimized. -- **@p0pr0ck5** [atlas#24954](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24954)
1. The list SSH keys API will now return a Not Found response instead of an empty response when accessed using an organization token. -- **@vikramraja1995** [atlas#24643](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24643)

1.

Now, the `local` part used for username generation will have a random 4 Byte length hex appended (e.g. `first.name3b9da8c7`) -- **@kdelancey-hashicorp** [atlas#24146](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24146)

1. You can now fetch the project ID from the runtime environment of a Terraform run. Users require the ID for many `tfe` provider resources and previously needed an extra data source call to retrieve it using the Project name. -- **@drewmullen** [atlas#24107](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24107)
1. A change was made to improve loading performance on the users management in the organization settings page. -- **@ignatius-j** [atlas#24454](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24454)
1.  -- **@ajmera-naman** [atlas#24138](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24138)
1. Update workspace destroy-settings page for project auto-destroy behavior. When a project auto-destroy plan is defined, the user should not be able to disable the "Allow destroy plan" setting. The UI page now does not show the toggle, instead showing an alert message telling the user that the project plan prevents that setting. -- **@KenCox-Hashicorp** [atlas#24420](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24420)
1. Improves performance where the application queries for workspaces by name -- **@RWJMurphy** [atlas#24486](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24486)
1. New users are now required to have more secure passwords. New users must have a password that is at least 8 characters long and contain at least 3 of the following: lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), special characters (!@#$%^&*)' -- **@lmatte7** [atlas#24416](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24416)
1. Agent pools that are still using stacks or that are still the default for a project can no longer be deleted. -- **@AlisonAcuna** [atlas#24524](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24524)
1. Admins can no longer generate tokens while impersonating a user in Terraform Enterprise. -- **@tauhid621** [atlas#24529](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24529)
1. Auto-destroy plans can no longer be disabled by setting the workspace "Allow destroy plan" to false. The previous behavior, in which the workspace setting blocked auto-destroy plans from running, was unintended. This includes validation which requires "Allow destroy plan" to be true if a project or workspace auto-destroy plan exists, and migrations to fix any invalid workspace settings. Note that if you have any workspaces with "Allow destroy plan" false, which are in a project with an auto-destroy plan, the auto-destroy will now be run against the workspace. To preserve such workspaces, move them to a project without an auto-destroy plan. -- **@KenCox-Hashicorp** [atlas#24535](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24535)
1. render lifecycle triggered actions in apply phase structured run output -- **@jyl625** [atlas#24514](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24514)

1. render lifecycle triggered actions in Plan phase structured run outputs -- **@jyl625** [atlas#24564](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24564)
1. Updates copy on runs filter to say "type" instead of "operation." This change includes the toggle and the dropdown where it says "filter by." -- **@RonRicardo** [atlas#24631](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24631)
1. Due to an issue where paginating by last-seen-at results in inconsistent pagination we are giving users an option to sort agents by created-at. -- **@twitnithegirl** [atlas#24262](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/24262)
