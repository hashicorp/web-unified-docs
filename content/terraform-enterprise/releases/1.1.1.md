## Known Issues

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where agents launched by Terraform Enterprise using a custom CA bundle, when Terraform Enterprise is using Docker as its run pipeline, would error when registering with Terraform Enterprise, resulting in Terraform runs failing to complete. Runs would remain in pending status and eventually fail with `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` errors.
