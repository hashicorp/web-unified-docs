# Terraform Enterprise on Replicated

Before Terraform Enterprise v202309-1, you could _only_ deploy Terraform Enterprise with Replicated. Introduced in v202309-1, Terraform Enterprise supports more [flexible deployment options](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/), such as Docker Engine and Kubernetes. If you are using Replicated today and want to migrate your Terraform Enterprise installation to an alternate deployment option, [refer to our migration guide](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration).

You can deploy Terraform Enterprise using the [Replicated Native Scheduler](https://help.replicated.com/docs/native/getting-started/overview/), bundling Replicated with Terraform Enterprise. Replicated provides self-managed platform capabilities such as installation, upgrade, container orchestration, platform administration, license management, and support bundles.
