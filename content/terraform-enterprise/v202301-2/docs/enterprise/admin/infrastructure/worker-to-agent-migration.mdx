# Migrate Alternative Worker Images to Agents: v202302-1

## Summary

The base image responsible for executing Terraform runs will change, beginning
with Terraform Enterprise v202302-1 (target date: February 21, 2023). Terraform Enterprise will stop supporting worker images in v202305-1 (target date: May 16, 2023).

If you are using the _default_ worker image, no further action is required. Terraform Enterprise will migrate you to the new image automatically in v202302-1 or later.

If you
currently use an [alternative worker
image](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#alternative-terraform-worker-image), Terraform Enterprise will continue using your image by default until you migrate your alternative worker image and manually switch to a custom agent.
Before adopting v202305-1, you must rebuild your alternative image using the [agent base
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent). If you also use the
[initialize](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#initialize-script) or
[finalize](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#finalize-script) hooks
available on custom worker images, you must update your customizations to use
the tfc-agent hooks instead.

Keep reading to learn how to check if you are impacted, and what action to take
if you are.

## What are alternative worker images?

Terraform Enterprise executes Terraform runs (plans and applies) in short-lived Docker containers. In some cases you may want to use tools that are not included in the default base image for these containers. Terraform Enterprise lets you upload an [alternative worker image](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#alternative-terraform-worker-image) that includes these tools. You can also use the initialize or finalize hooks included in the image to execute custom scripts before and after the run, respectively. 

## What’s changing and why?

We are replacing three components of the run pipeline, `terraform-build-worker`,
`terraform-build-manager`, and `tfe-rabbitmq` with local Terraform Cloud/Enterprise
agents. If you use an alternative worker image to execute custom logic within
the run lifecycle, you will need to migrate that logic to a custom
agent image.

Like Terraform runs that use alternative worker images, runs that use custom agents will still execute in isolated,
short-lived [Docker
containers](/enterprise/system-overview/security-model#terraform-enterprise-isolates-terraform-operations-via-docker-containers).
The Terraform Runs API and UI are also unaffected by this change.

This change is part of an ongoing effort to refresh the architecture of
Terraform Enterprise, improve performance and reliability of runs, and support
new application-level features. Some immediate benefits of this change include:

- The run pipeline contains fewer components, making it easier to understand and debug.
- Local runs and remote agent runs can now use the same base images, and the
  same pre- and post- run hooks. 
- Run distribution across Active/Active nodes is more even because we eliminated
  a redundant queue. 
- You can now access previously inaccessible run logs (Sentinel, cost
  estimation, and plan-export-worker logs) via Docker logs and any tool that can
  interact with it. This includes the `docker logs` command, the Docker API, and
  [TFE log forwarding](/enterprise/admin/infrastructure/logging).

In v202302-1, Terraform Enterprise installations using the default worker image (not an alternative worker image) will automatically use the new run pipeline.

Installations that  use an alternative worker image will continue to use the legacy run pipeline when you upgrade to v202302-1. You must migrate your TFE installation to use a custom agent before adopting v202305-1, which involves rebuilding your alternative worker image as a custom agent image. 

Once you rebuild your image, you must manually switch to the new run pipeline by setting the `run_pipeline_mode = “agent”`. You can revert back to the legacy run pipeline at any time before you adopt v202305-1 by setting `run_pipeline_mode = “legacy”`. The legacy option will become unavailable in v202305-1 and later.

## Check for an alternative worker image

By default Terraform Enterprise uses a standard image included in all releases. Check your config to find out if you have previously specified an Alternative Worker Image. 

In the Admin Console's **Settings** tab, check if **Provide the location of a custom image** is selected. If yes, your Alternative Worker Image location is specified in the **Custom Image Tag** field that follows.

![Screenshot of the TFE Admin Console with the option to provide the location of a
custom image selected with a radio button, and the location of the image in a
text box below](/img/docs/build-worker.png)

You can also check if you are using an alternative worker image directly in your
config file. In your config file, the field `custom_image_tag` is the name of
your alternative worker image.

## Migrate to a custom agent image

To migrate to a custom agent image, start by understanding the customizations on
your worker image. Then build your new agent image, add your customizations, and
test the new, customized image. 

### Step 1: Evaluate customizations in your current image

Before making any changes, you must evaluate your current image and familiarize yourself with all customizations that have been implemented in the past. 


Consider the following:
- What custom tools are embedded in your image?
- Are you using the initialize and/or finalize hook(s)?
- If yes, what do your initialize and/or finalize script(s) do?

### Step 2: Build your new custom agent image

The Docker container that Terraform Cloud and Enterprise will use for Terraform
operations starting with v202302-1 is based on the
[`hashicorp/tfc-agent`](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent) Docker
image. Like the old worker image, the agent image can be customized to execute
custom functionality, but there are several implementation differences between
worker images and agent images to consider.

The following tables describe the differences between the
old alternative worker image and the new custom agent image.

#### Use an image

||Alternative Worker Image|Custom Agent Image|
|---|---|---|
|Docs: build a custom image|[Documentation](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#requirements)|[Documentation](/cloud-docs/agents/agents#optional-configuration-run-an-agent-using-docker)|
|Docs: execute scripts|[Documentation](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#executing-custom-scripts)|[Documentation](/cloud-docs/agents/hooks)|
|Use the image in your config|Set the name of the alternative docker image using the `custom_image_tag` config option.|Set the name of the alternative Docker image using the `custom_agent_image_tag` config option.|
|Image location|The image must be located on the host.|If Terraform Enterprise doesn't find the image on the host, it will try to pull it from the specified location.|

#### Customize an image 

||Alternative Worker Image|Custom Agent Image|
|---|---|---|
|Base image|The base image must be `ubuntu:bionic` or an official RHEL7 image (e.g., `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi-minimal`).|The base image must be the `hashicorp/tfc-agent`.|
|Image location|The image must exist on the Terraform Enterprise host. You can add it by running `docker pull` from a local registry or any other similar method.|We recommend that the image exist locally, but if the image doesn’t exist locally, the `tfe-task-worker` docker driver will pull the image from the specified source.|
|Required software|The software packages defined [here](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#requirements) must be installed on the image.|N/A|
|Certificates|All necessary PEM-encoded CA certificates must be placed within the `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` directory. Each file added to this directory must end with the `.crt` extension. The CA certificates configured in the CA Bundle settings will not be automatically added to this image at runtime.|All necessary PEM-encoded CA certificates must be placed within the `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` directory. Each file added to this directory must end with the `.crt` extension. The CA certificates configured in the CA Bundle settings will not be automatically added to this image at runtime. <br/><br/> This will be similar to the certificate config in this [Dockerfile example](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#ubuntu).|
|Terraform binary|Terraform must not be installed on the image. Terraform Enterprise installs Terraform at runtime.|Terraform must not be installed on the image. Terraform Enterprise installs Terraform at runtime.|
|Rhel 7|In addition to the packages that yum installs, curl installs the envdir tool Python port because it is a dependency of the Terraform Build Worker service. If the envdir tool is not installed on the alternative worker image, Terraform runs will fail within Terraform Enterprise.|N/A|
|Run before plans and applies|The same [initialize script](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#initialize-script) runs before a `terraform init` during both plans and applies.|You can have separate [hooks](/cloud-docs/agents/hooks#supported-hooks) that run before and after plans and applies: <br/> `terraform-pre-plan` <br/> `terraform-pre-apply`.|
|Run after plans and applies|The same [finalize script](/enterprise/install/interactive/installer#finalize-script) runs after terraform plan  and terraform apply are finished executing.|You can have separate [hooks](/cloud-docs/agents/hooks#supported-hooks) that run before and after plans and applies: <br/> `terraform-post-plan` <br/> `terraform-post-apply`|
|Configuration|Ensure your worker image contains an executable shell script at: <br/> `/usr/local/bin/init_custom_worker.sh` <br/> `/usr/local/bin/finalize_custom_worker.sh`|Store hooks in a hooks directory, and name them according to their purpose. For example: <br/> `~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan` <br/> `~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-post-plan` <br/> `~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-apply` <br/> `~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-post-apply`|
|Non-zero exit codes|If the script exits with a non-zero exit code, the Terraform Enterprise run will immediately fail with an error.|If a `terraform apply` does not complete successfully, the hook will still run. If a hook exits with a non-zero exit code, the Terraform run will fail immediately.|
|`stdout`/`stderr`|The build worker logs whether or not a custom script has executed but does not log the script's standard output and standard error. If the custom script exits non-zero, then its standard output and standard error print to the UI logs.|The standard output and standard error from the hook will print alongside the Terraform run output in the Terraform Cloud/Enterprise user interface, but not in the UI logs.|
|File locations|You can not customize the name or location of the script.|The hook name must match one of the [supported hooks](/cloud-docs/agents/hooks#supported-hooks). You cannot customize or change these names. Because of this, there can only be one hook of each type configured for each agent. For example, you could create a pre-plan and pre-apply hook, but you cannot create two pre-plan hooks.|
|Script permissions|The script must have execute permissions.|Each hook must have the execute permission set.|
|Execution timeout|The execution of the script does not have a timeout. It is up to the Terraform Enterprise administrator to ensure scripts execute in a timely fashion.|Each hook has a 60 second timeout. If a hook times out the Terraform run will fail immediately.|
|Execution context|The execution of the script is not sandboxed. The script executes in the same container where `terraform` runs, and both can access the same set of environment variables.|Like with alternative worker images, the execution of the script is not sandboxed. The script executes in the same container where `terraform` runs, and both can access the same set of environment variables.|
|Reading and writing variables|Users can "export" environment variables for subsequent Terraform commands (plan, apply, etc) to use, by writing their environment variable value to a file `/env/FOO` where `FOO` is the name of the environment variable.|You can not persist environment variables from the custom script to subsequent Terraform commands (plan, apply, etc) like you could with build workers. There is no concept of an `/env` directory in agents. Custom scripts run as a child process, so environment variables from the export command will not persist after the custom script finishes executing.|
|Running in Docker|Example Dockerfile snippet: <br/> `ADD init_custom_worker.sh /usr/local/bin/init_custom_worker.sh`|When running `tfc-agent` using Docker, you must build a new Docker image containing the hooks. To configure hooks, [follow these instructions](/cloud-docs/agents/hooks#running-an-agent-with-docker).|
|Execute/running as a binary|Scripts always run in the worker container. To execute, initialize and finalize scripts and all the commands they invoke, ensure your worker image contains an executable shell script at `/usr/local/bin/<init or finalize>_custom_worker.sh`.|If you want to run agents outside of containers, you must create your own remote agent pool. <br/><br/> To run hooks as a binary, you need to [change the permissions to the hook scripts](/cloud-docs/agents/hooks#running-an-agent-as-a-binary).|

### Step 3: Test your custom agent image

We strongly recommend that you test your custom agent image before applying it to your production installation of Terraform Enterprise.

#### Test on Terraform Enterprise v202301 or earlier

Agents have not yet replaced build workers in v202301 and earlier, but you can still test your agent image by configuring a test workspace to use a remote agent. You will need to install your agent on the host of your choice, and configure your workspace to use that agent. Follow the process described [here](/cloud-docs/agents/agents) for more details.

#### Test on Terraform Enterprise v202302 or later

To test in v202302 or later, install a test installation of Terraform Enterprise, define a `custom_agent_image_tag`, and set `run_pipeline_mode = “agent”` in your test installation’s config.

### Step 4: Adopt the new image

Once you have completed your migration and tested the new custom agent image, adopt the new image into your production Terraform Enterprise installation (v202302 or later) by defining a `custom_agent_image_tag`, and setting `run_pipeline_mode = “agent”` in your config file.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q. I had an Alternative Worker Image configured, but I don’t need the customizations anymore. What should I do?**

**A.** If you want to use the default agent image going forward instead of a customized image, please remove your alternative worker image from use before you upgrade to v202302-1. If you want to remove the alternative worker image after upgrading to v202302-1 or higher, set `run_pipeline_mode = “agent”` in your config without specifying a custom agent image.

**Q. I’m already using a custom image for my remote agents. Can I re-use that image for my local agent image?**

**A.** Yes. If your remote agent image accomplishes everything you want, you can specify that image as your Custom Agent Image.

**Q. I’m using an alternative worker image, when do I need to complete my migration to a custom agent image?**

**A.** Terraform Enterprise will stop supporting workers in v202305-1. To maintain your customizations, you must complete your migration to a custom agent image before upgrading to v202305-1 or later.

**Q. Can I switch back to the legacy run pipeline?**

**A.** Yes, until v202305-1 you can switch between workers and agents. To switch back to the worker run pipeline, set `run_pipeline_mode = “legacy”` in your config. We will remove legacy mode in v202305-1.

**Q. I am using an alternative worker image to dynamically manage run credentials. What is the best way to accomplish this with a custom agent image?**

**A.** You can dynamically manage credentials using workspace variables and/or agent hooks. Upcoming enhancements to Terraform Enterprise will make this easier. Please reach out to your HashiCorp account representative for more information.

**Q. I have a custom workflow on my alternative worker image that doesn’t seem possible on a custom agent image. What should I do?**

**A.** Please reach out to your HashiCorp account representative for further guidance.
