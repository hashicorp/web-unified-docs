# Manage projects

This topic describes how to create and manage projects in HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise. A project is a folder containing one or more workspaces.

## Requirements

You must have the following permissions to manage projects:

-   You must be a member of a team with the **Manage all Projects**  permissions enabled to create a project. Refer to [Organization Permissions](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) for additional information.
-   You must be a member of a team with the **Visible** option enabled under **Visibility** in the organization settings to configure a new team's access to the project. Refer to [Team Visibility](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/teams/manage#team-visibility) for additional information.
-   You must be a member of a team with update and delete permissions to be able to update and delete teams respectively.

## View a project

To view your organization's projects:

1.  Click **Projects**.
2.  Search for a project that you want to view. You can use the following methods:
    -   Sort by column header.
    -   Use the search bar to search on the name of a project or a tag.
3.  Click on a project's name to view more details.

## Create a project

1.  Click **Projects**.

2.  Click **+ New project**.

1.  Specify a name for the project. The name must be unique within the organization and can only include letters, numbers, inner spaces, hyphens, and underscores.

1.  Add a description for the project. This field is optional.

1.  Click **Create** to finish creating the project.

A new project page opens that displays the information about the project.

## Edit a project

1.  Click **Projects**.
2.  Click on a project name of the project you want to edit.
3.  Click **Settings**.

On this **General settings** page, you can update the project name, project
description, and delete the project. On the **Team access** page, you can modify
team access to the project.

## Automatically destroy inactive workspaces

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/ephemeral-workspaces.mdx'

<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

You can configure HCP Terraform to automatically destroy each workspace's
infrastructure in a project after a period of inactivity. A workspace
is inactive if the workspace's state has not changed within your designated
time period.

If you configure a project to auto-destroy its infrastructure when inactive, 
any run that updates Terraform state further delays the scheduled auto-destroy 
time by the length of your designated timeframe.

!> **Warning:** Automatic destroy plans do not prompt you for apply approval in the HCP Terraform user interface. We recommend only using this setting for development environments.

To schedule an auto-destroy run after a period of workspace inactivity:

1.  Navigate to the project's **Settings** > **Auto-destroy Workspaces** page.
2.  Click **Set up default**.
3.  Select or customize a desired timeframe of inactivity.
4.  Click **Confirm default**.

You can configure an individual workspace's auto-destroy settings to override
this default configuration. Refer to [automatically destroy workspaces](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/settings/deletion#automatically-destroy) for more information.

## Delete a project

You can only delete projects that do not contain workspaces.

To delete an empty project:

1.  Click **Projects**.
2.  Search for a project that you want to review by scrolling down the table or
    searching for a project name in the search bar above the project table.
3.  Click **Settings**. The settings view for the selected project appears.
4.  Click the **Delete** button. A **Delete project** modal appears.
5.  Click the **Delete** button to confirm the deletion.

Terraform Enterprise returns to the **Projects** view with the deleted project
removed from the list.
