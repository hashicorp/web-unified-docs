# Registry Partnership API Endpoint

Admins and operators who install and maintain their organization's Terraform Enterprise instance are able to use the `registry-partnerships` endpoint to configure registry sharing. 

## Introduction

There are two ways to configure registry sharing via the Admin API:

- This endpoint, which allows an organization to share modules and providers with a specific list of other organizations.
- The [update an organization endpoint](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/admin/organizations#update-an-organization), whose `data.attributes.global-module-sharing` and `data.attributes.global-provider-sharing` properties allows an organization to share modules and providers with every organization in the instance.

Enabling one option will automatically disable the other. For more information, see [Administration: Registry Sharing](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/registry-sharing).

## Update an Organization's Provider Partnership

-> This API endpoint is available in Terraform Enterprise as of version 202301-1.

`PUT /admin/organizations/:name/registry-partnerships`

This endpoint sets the list of organizations that can use modules and providers from the sharing organization's private registry. Sharing with specific organizations will automatically turn off global module and/or provider sharing, which is configured with the [update an organization endpoint](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/admin/organizations#update-an-organization) (via the `data.attributes.global-module-sharing` and `data.attributes.global-provider-sharing` properties).
