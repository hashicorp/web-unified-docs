### Externalizing secret values

The Terraform Enterprise deployment configuration requires several secret values, such as keys, passwords, and certificates. You can populate these as part of the Helm `overrides.yaml` created before installation. However, this requires manual handling of secret values and may leave them exposed on the deployment host without further intervention.

To mitigate this security concern, HashiCorp recommends populating these secret values into a Kubernetes Secret from a centralized secrets management platform using a trusted orchestrator like the [Vault Secrets Operator](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso) before installing Terraform Enterprise.

You can then reference the Kubernetes Secret in the Terraform Enterprise Helm Chart:

```yaml
env:
  secretRefs:
    - name: terraform-enterprise-managed-secrets
```

Terraform Enterprise also supports the [Vault CSI provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/csi).
This allows TFE pods to consume Vault secrets using CSI Secrets Store volumes.
More information can be found in the [Helm Chart documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#vault-csi-provider).
