# Terraform Enterprise v202501-1 (806)

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:53a98c93d4f5e6655b439569d7fce717521e4e5655e3cf4ee107d0536fb47f0d`

## Known Issues
1. Terraform Enterprise does not support usernames provided with the  `REDIS_USER ` variable to  authenticate with an external Redis instance.

## Deprecations

1. Terraform Enterprise now supports new deployment options and will end support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option.
The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in March 2025 (extended from November 2024). Effective December 2024,
only pre-existing workflows and capabilities will be tested for continued quality on Replicated releases. New features and product
improvements will not be validated on Replicated releases. HashiCorp Support will support this release until April 1, 2026, but
bug and security fixes backports will not be available after March.
2. Redis 6.0 has reached end of life. Terraform Enterprise will stop supporting Redis 6.0 in April 2025. Note that this only applies
to Active-Active deployment models; Terraform Enterprise instances with external services on mounted disk deployment modes use an
internal Redis instance that is automatically updated as part of the Terraform Enterprise release process.

## Features

1. You can now generate dynamic provider credentials for AWS and GCP using HCP Vault Secrets-backed dynamic provider credentials.

## Improvements

1. If Terraform Enterprise's underlying infrastructure fails and runs appear stuck in the queued state, Terraform Enterprise identifies and updates those runs to an errored state.
2. Terraform Enterprise now includes run metadata in the streaming output logs of the `task-worker` service, such as the run ID, workload type, and organization and workspace names. This improves observability when examining logs for a specific run.
3. Terraform Enterprise now returns a specific error when it rejects streaming log uploads because of a lack of space in the cache. This change reduces network and CPU overhead for long-running jobs with large output.
4. You can now use parameters for managed policies.
5. Update Sentinel to 0.29 to stay in line with latest release.

## Bug Fixes

1. Resolved a bug where a no-op background migration could be stuck in an infinite loop, causing background migrations not to start.
2. Fixed an issue where certain Azure VM SKU/region combinations would cause cost estimation to hang indefinitely.
3. Fixed an issue with Azure DevOps Services & Server's new token format, causing validation errors when saving new OAuth Clients.
4. Fixes log streaming not automatically refreshing when using the console workspace UI setting.
5. Run tokens now last as long as the configured timeout for the operation they apply to, helping resolve errors where plans appear to succeed but the run fails due to token expiration. For example, if the plan timeout for an organization is 3 hours, the run token used to authenticate the plan will last longer than 3 hours.
6. Fixed the bug where invalid workspaces could cause the backfill migration to run forever.

## Security

1. If the IdP certificate is expired, SAML login fails with the following message: "IdP x509 certificate expired".
