# Troubleshooting common application errors

This topic describes the errors Terraform Enterprise may report if your deployment is misconfigured and how to resolve them.

## Kubernetes Fails to Pull Image

### Symptom

Kubernetes pods are failing to pull the container image with a `BackOff` error.

### Signals

`kubectl describe pod` is stuck in the `Waiting` state with the `ErrImagePull`
reason.

```sh
$ kubectl describe pod terraform-enterprise-7f649f6598-2k79b
...
Containers:
  terraform-enterprise:
    State:          Waiting
      Reason:       ErrImagePull
...
```

### Solution

Update the image pull policy for the deployment to `always`.

## Empty S3 static credentials

### Symptom

Application fails to start.

### Signals

Logs show the following S3 prefix detection error.

```sh
2023-05-10T23:38:18.100Z [ERROR] terraform-enterprise: startup: error="failed detecting s3 prefix: could not list objects: operation error S3: ListObjectsV2, failed to sign request: failed to retrieve credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials, static credentials are empty"
```

### Solution

Set `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_USE_INSTANCE_PROFILE` to `true` when using IAM auth
for S3.

## Unknown certificate with VCS integration

### Symptom

You cannot configure a VCS connection within Terraform Enterprise.

### Signals

Setting up VCS fails with `unknown certificate issuer` error.

### Solution

Include the CA certificate for your VCS server in the CA Bundle. Ensure the
`TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` is set to a path pointing to your CA bundle.

## Unknown certificate with failing Terraform runs

### Symptom

Terraform plans and applies fail.

### Signals

Logs for task worker and archivist show an x509 error.

### Solution

Include the CA certificates for all hosts that Terraform must communicate with,
including your Terraform Enterprise server itself, in the CA Bundle. Ensure the
`TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` is set to a path pointing to your CA bundle.

## Unable to fetch Terraform binary

### Symptom

Terraform plans and applies fail with `failed downloading terraform`.

### Signals

Terraform run logs contain.

```sh
Operation failed: failed fetching Terraform: failed downloading terraform: failed downloading "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.2/terraform_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip": GET https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.2/terraform_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip giving up after 5 attempt(s): failed making temp file: open /tmp/terraform/8c23e18ed1846a552fc22ed5ee80eec9.download-67d5219a-aa5c-cd41-3262-2b9d57c1bfe2: read-only file system
```

### Solution

Ensure the `TFE_DISK_CACHE_PATH` location is properly backed by a writable
volume.

## Unable to write to database after a failover

### Symptom

If Terraform Enteprise is connected to a PostgreSQL database cluster, you may experience issues after a failover. 

### Signals

The Vault logs contain the following entry: 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>
<CodeBlock>

cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction (SQLSTATE 25006)

</CodeBlock>
</CodeBlockConfig>

### Solutions

You may need to manually address issues after a failover to return to functionality. The Vault process may still be connected to a read-only instance if the affected instance can not process runs. Perform the following actions to resolve this issue: 

1. Restart Terraform Enterprise. 

1. Reopen sealed Vault processes. If the Vault process seals before the failover resolves, either restart Terraform Enterprise or restart the Vault process. Use the following command to restart the Vault process:

  ```sh
  $ supervisorctl restart tfe:vault
  ```
