### Amazon CloudWatch

Sending to Amazon CloudWatch is only supported when Terraform Enterprise is
located within AWS due to how Fluent Bit reads AWS credentials.

This example configuration forwards all logs to Amazon CloudWatch. Refer to the
[`cloudwatch_logs` Fluent Bit output plugin documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/cloudwatch)
for more information.

```ini
[OUTPUT]
    Name               cloudwatch_logs
    Match              *
    region             us-east-1
    log_group_name     example-log-group
    log_stream_name    example-log-stream
    auto_create_group  On

Fluent Bit will have access to the same `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables that are used for object storage.

### Amazon S3

Sending to Amazon S3 is only supported when Terraform Enterprise is located
within AWS due to how Fluent Bit reads AWS credentials.
