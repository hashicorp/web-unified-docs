  Installation guidance for Terraform Enterprise's flexible deployment options.

# Installation

Terraform Enterprise supports installation on [Docker](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/install) and [Kubernetes](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/install). If you are currently running Terraform Enterprise on Replicated, follow the [migration guide](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration) to move to Flexible Deployment Options. 

Please review the various requirements prior to installation:

- [Shared requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements)

- [Docker requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/requirements)

- [Kubernetes requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/requirements)

While Terraform Enterprise may be functional in runtime environments not listed in our official deployment options, we
strongly recommend that you only use officially supported deployment options in production environments.

Operational Terraform Enterprise environments are composed primarily of two components: server containers, and Terraform
run containers (agents). While server containers are long-lived, run containers are ephemeral environments spawned by
the server container as needed. Terraform Enterprise relies on runtime environment APIs (eg: Docker API, Kubernetes API)
to spawn run containers.

The following risks exist when operating Terraform Enterprise in unsupported environments:
- Terraform Enterprise may not be able to execute runs because it may not be able to communicate with the runtime environmentâ€™s API,
- Higher risk of quality issues due to the deployment environment not being included in release testing,
- HashiCorp will not be able to provide configuration guidance for Terraform Enterprise in your deployment environment,
- If issues occur, HashiCorp support may not be able to help. You may need to reproduce the issue in a supported environment before getting support.

## Tested environments include:

Docker
- Docker on a Linux VM, using any Linux OS

Kubernetes
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Google Cloud Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Azure Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Podman
- Podman on a RedHat Enterprise Linux VM, using RHEL 8 or higher
