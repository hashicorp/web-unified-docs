# Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options upgrade

Follow these steps to upgrade Terraform Enterprise.

1. We recommend upgrading a non-production environment before upgrading your production instance of Terraform Enterprise.

1. We recommend backing up your Terraform Enterprise data before upgrading. For best practices, refer to our recommended patterns for [backing up](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups) and [restoring](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-recovery) your data.

1. Stop terraform runs by [draining instance nodes](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/admin/admin-cli/admin-cli#gracefully-stop-work-on-a-node).

1. For a multi-node setup, scale down to a single node.

1. Stop the Terraform Enterprise application.
