# License and product usage reporting
This topic describes how to enable Terraform Enterprise to report license and product usage information to HashiCorp. This topic also outlines how HashiCorp uses license and product data it collects when automated data reporting is enabled. It is enabled by default, but automated license and product utilization data reporting can be disabled separately.

## Data reporting privacy
The process is GDPR compliant and consists of mostly computed metrics that never contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information. Automated reporting shares the data with HashiCorp using a secure, unidirectional HTTPS API and makes an auditable record in the product logs each time it submits a report.

## Enable automated license utilization reporting
When automated license usage reporting is enabled, Terraform sends HashiCorp the minimum data required to validate license usage as defined in our contracts. As a result, you do not have to manually collect and report the usage data. 

License usage reports provide the following benefits:

- Insight into how much more you can deploy under your current contract. 
- Protection against over-utilization. 
- Predictable consumption for budgeting purposes. 

Additionally, you can review license usage with your existing monitoring solutions, such as Splunk and Datadog. Monitoring license consumption enables you to optimize and manage your deployments. For instructions on how to forward your license usage data to a monitoring solution, refer to [Log Forwarding on Replicated Installs](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/monitoring/logging) or [Log Forwarding on FDO](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/observability/logs#external-log-forwarding).


To enable automated reporting, you need to make sure that outbound network traffic is configured correctly and upgrade your enterprise product to a version that supports it. If your installation is air-gapped or network settings are not in place, automated reporting will not work.

### Allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443

Make sure that your network allows HTTPS egress on port 443 from `https://reporting.hashicorp.services` by allow-listing the following IP addresses:

- `100.20.70.12`
- `35.166.5.22`
- `23.95.85.111`
- `44.215.244.1`
