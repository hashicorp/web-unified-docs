# Set up the GitLab.com VCS provider

These instructions describe how to connect to GitLab.com. Refer to [GitLab EE](/terraform/enterprise/vcs/gitlab-eece) for instructions on connecting to GitLab EE. Refer to [VCS overview](/terraform/enterprise/vcs) for information about abll VCS integrations.

## Overview

Complete the following steps to connect to GitLab.com:

1. Create a new connection in HCP Terraform. Get redirect URI. 
1. Register your HCP Terraform organization as a new app in GitLab. Provide redirect URI.
1. Provide HCP Terraform with application ID and secret. Request VCS access.
1. Approve access request in GitLab.com.

Alternately, you can skip the OAuth configuration process and authenticate with a personal access token. This requires using HCP Terraform's API. For details, see [the OAuth Clients API page](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/oauth-clients).

## Requirements

Configuring a new VCS provider requires permission to manage VCS settings for the organization. Refer to [Permissions](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions) for more information.

## Create a new connection in HCP Terraform

1.  Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the organization where you want to add the VCS provider.

2.  Choose **Settings** from the sidebar, then click **Providers**.

3.  Click **Add VCS Provider**. The **VCS Providers** page appears.

4.  Select **GitLab** and then select **GitLab.com** from the menu. The page moves to the next step.

5.  Locate the "Redirect URI" and copy it to your clipboard; you'll paste it in the next step.

Leave the page open in a browser tab. In the next step you will copy values from this page, and in later steps you will continue configuring HCP Terraform.

## Register your HCP Terraform organization in GitLab

1. In a new browser tab, open [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) and log in as whichever account you want HCP Terraform to act as. For most organizations this should be a dedicated service user, but a personal account will also work.

    The account you use for connecting HCP Terraform **must have Maintainer access** to any shared repositories of Terraform configurations, since creating webhooks requires Maintainer permissions. Refer to [the GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions) for details.

1. Click your profile picture and choose **Settings**.
1. Click **Applications**.
1. Configure the follwoing settings using the corresponding values displayed in your HCP Terraform browser tab. HCP Terraform lists the values in the order they appear, and includes controls for copying values to your clipboard:
    - **Name**: Terraform Enterprise (`<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME>`).    
    - **Redirect URI**: `https://app.terraform.io/<YOUR CALLBACK URL>`, the redirect URI you copied from HCP Terraform.
    - Enable the **Confidential** option.                                                                                    
    - Enable all fo the options under **Scopes**. These options correspond to the `api` settings.                                                                                            

1. Click **Save application**, which creates the application and takes you to its page. Do not close this page. In the next step, you will copy and paste the unique **Application ID** and **Secret.**

## Provide HCP Terraform with the application ID and secret

1.  Enter the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the previous step, as well as an option **Name** for this VCS connection.

2.  Click **Connect and continue.** This takes you to a page on GitLab.com, which asks if you want to authorize the app.

3.  Click the green **Authorize** button at the bottom of the authorization page.

## Configure advanced settings in Terraform Enterprise (optional)

The settings in this section are optional. You can configure the following advanced settings:

-   **Scope of VCS Provider** - You can configure which workspaces can use repositories from this VCS provider. By default the **All Projects** option is selected, meaning this VCS provider is available to be used by all workspaces in the organization.
-   **Set up SSH Keypair** - Most organizations will not need to add an SSH key. However, if the organization repositories include Git submodules that can only be accessed via SSH, an SSH key can be added along with the OAuth credentials. You can add or update the SSH key at a later time.

If you do not need to configure advanced settings, click the **Skip and Finish** button after [registering your organization in GitLab](#register-your-hcp-terraform-organization-in-gitlab). This returns you to HCP Terraform's VCS Provider page, which now includes your new GitLab client.

### Limit the scope of this VCS provider

1.  Select the **Selected Projects** option and use the text field that appears to search for and select projects to enable. All current and future workspaces for any selected projects can use repositories from this VCS Provider. 

2.  Click the **Update VCS Provider** button to save your selections.

### Create an SSH keypair

SSH is only used to clone Git submodules. All other Git operations use HTTPS. Do not use your personal SSH key to connect HCP Terraform and GitLab. Generate a new key or use an existing key reserved for service access.

In the following steps, you must provide HCP Terraform with the private key. Although HCP Terraform does not display the text of the key to users after it is entered, it retains the key text and uses it when authenticating to GitLab.

**Protect this private key carefully.** Someone can use it to push code to the repositories you use to manage your infrastructure. Take note of your organization's policies for protecting important credentials and be sure to follow them.

1.  On a secure workstation, create an SSH keypair that HCP Terraform can use to connect to GitLab.com. The exact command depends on your OS, but is usually something like:
    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f "/Users/<NAME>/.ssh/service_terraform" -C "service_terraform_enterprise"`
    This creates a `service_terraform` file with the private key, and a `service_terraform.pub` file with the public key. This SSH key **must have an empty passphrase**. HCP Terraform cannot use SSH keys that require a passphrase.

2.  While logged into the GitLab.com account you want HCP Terraform to act as, navigate to the SSH Keys settings page, add a new SSH key and paste the value of the SSH public key you just created.

3.  In HCP Terraform's **Add VCS Provider** page, paste the text of the **SSH private key** you just created, and click the **Add SSH Key** button.

## Next steps

At this point, GitLab.com access for HCP Terraform is fully configured, and you can create Terraform workspaces based on your organization's shared repositories.
