# Change requests overview

Change requests are a way to create a backlog of action items recorded on a workspace, enabling administrators to notify teams directly if a workspace requires action. Workspace action items can include updating [deprecated or revoked module versions](/terraform/enterprise/registry/manage-module-versions), security updates, bugs, or compliance fixes.

Change requests let you record tasks directly on the workspaces that need those changes. When someone addresses a change request, they can archive it to reflect its completion.

## Introduction

The [explorer for workspace visibility](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/explorer) helps surface valuable information across your organization. While browsing data about workspaces in the explorer, you may find workspaces that need to be updated or fixed. You can keep your context and create a change request directly from the explorer to leave action items on workspaces.

You can also [save a view in the explorer](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/explorer#save-a-view) if you want to revisit workspaces for which you created a change request or if you need to regularly create change requests for specific workspaces.

If a specific person or team owns a workspace, you can set up and configure a team notification to directly notify that person or team if one of their workspaces has a new change request. Refer to [Team notifications](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/teams/notifications) to learn more.

## Primary workflow

Administrators can [create new change requests](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/change-requests/manage#create-a-change-request) directly from explorer queries on workspace data. After selecting the workspaces to include in the request, they can write a message describing the details and goal of that change request.

Workspaces manage and track their change requests directly, and team members can [archive a change request](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/change-requests/manage#archive-existing-change-requests) once they’ve completed that request’s task.
