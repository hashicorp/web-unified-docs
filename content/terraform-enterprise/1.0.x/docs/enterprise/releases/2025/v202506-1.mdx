# Terraform Enterprise v202506-1

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:95b5bc9cbcf0e7f91b0d1ef4173b30f403aa1e018dae173841538f0c03500c29`

## Deprecations

1. Terraform Enterprise is transitioning from monthly releases to a quarterly releases. We are also changing from a date-based version scheme to a semantic versioning-like scheme. Each version is numbered according to milestone, major, and patch release represented as `x.y.z`. Under this scheme, we will publish a milestone or major release quarterly. Releases will receive monthly patches until the next quarterly release becomes available. This change is intended to provide a more predictable and stable release cycle, allowing for better planning and implementation of updates. **The last monthly release with `YYYYMMDD` versioning will be in July. The first quarterly release with `x.y.z` versioning will be 1.0.0 in August.**

## Highlights

## Features

1. When used within Terraform Enterprise instances, Redis standalone and Redis Enterprise data stores now support mTLS. This ensures that only clients with valid certificates can connect. Passwords are no longer required.

## Improvements
1.  Azure DevOps Services users can now set up VCS connections using Entra OAuth Apps. Microsoft has stopped accepting new Azure DevOps OAuth app registrations.
1. Fixed failures in edge cases during force-cancelation of runs
1. Bump Sentinel to 0.40.0 to stay in-line with most recent changes

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed validation on email addresses in the forgotten password form, ensuring inputs are now validated consistently.
1. Changed the process for exporting plans to Sentinel. This change resolves potential process timing issues.
1. Ignore branch-related fields when switching to tag-based triggers to prevent unnecessary runs.
1. Site admins can view metadata for user tokens, including token count, `created_at`, and `last_used` timestamps.
1. [IPL-5978] Fixed an issue in the private registry in which the no-code icon appeared in the version drop-down for versions where no-code provisioning is disabled.

## Security
1. Improved email security by allowing you to require the `StartTLS` command while connecting to SMTP servers, preventing fallback to unencrypted connections.
