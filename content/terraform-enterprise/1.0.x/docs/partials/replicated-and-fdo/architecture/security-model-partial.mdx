## Personas

In addition to those listed in [HCP Terraform Security model](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/security-model), Terraform Enterprise requires the following personas for managing and administering the application.

### Infrastructure Admin

Outside of the application, administrators of the Terraform Enterprise deployment are responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure and upgrading the application. We recommend limiting the number of users who are infrastructure admins in your organization.

### Site Admin

[Site admins](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/admin-access) are responsible for application-level configuration of Terraform Enterprise. They can manage all users, workspaces, and organizations through the admin interface and have access to all data stored within Terraform Enterprise. Site admins are also responsible for configuring SAML and are the only users that can access Terraform Enterprise with a username and password once SAML is configured.

Terraform Enterprise grants extensive permissions to this role, so we recommend limiting the number of users who are site admins in your organization.

## Differences Between Terraform Enterprise and HCP Terraform Security Models

All of the content on [HCP Terraform security model](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/security-model) applies to Terraform Enterprise, with the exception of the points listed below.

### Terraform Enterprise Requires You to Manage and Secure the Underlying Network and Infrastructure

Infrastructure admins are required to manage all aspects of the underlying infrastructure. This includes initial provisioning, secure configuration, access control, network ACL configuration, and OS-level software updates. Terraform Enterprise cannot ensure the security of your data if the underlying infrastructure is compromised.

### You are Responsible for Updating Your Terraform Enterprise Deployment

We release security fixes, application features, and bug fixes for Terraform Enterprise each month. Infrastructure admins are responsible for applying updates.

### You are Responsible for Availability, Backups, and Disaster Recovery

Infrastructure admins are responsible for all aspects of reliability and availability. Refer to Terraform Enterprise documentation on [monitoring](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor), [backups and restores](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/backup-restore), and [high availability mode (active/active)](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for more guidance on this topic.

### Terraform Enterprise Isolates Terraform Operations via Docker Containers

Unlike HCP Terraform, Terraform Enterprise performs all Terraform operations in Docker containers on the Terraform Enterprise host. The containers are assigned to an isolated Docker network to prevent them from communicating with Terraform Enterprise backend services. However, Terraform Enterprise does not perform any egress filtering, so Terraform runs can still access available network resources.

## Recommendations for Securely Operating Terraform Enterprise

In addition those provided in the [HCP Terraform security model](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/security-model), we recommend the following for Terraform Enterprise users.

### Run Terraform Enterprise in an Isolated Network, Limit Ingress Ports, and Restrict Access to Underlying Infrastructure

To minimize attack surface, we recommend running Terraform Enterprise in an isolated network and limiting ingress ports to only 80 and 443, as documented in [Network Requirements for Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/network).

Additionally, we recommend restricting access to the nodes that are running Terraform Enterprise. Terraform Enterprise can not ensure the security or integrity of your data if the underlying infrastructure is compromised.

### Enable Optional Security Features

Once you are ready to use Terraform Enterprise for production workloads, we recommend enabling these optional security features.

#### Secure Secondary Hostnames

You can configure Terraform Enterprise to allow incoming connections at more than one hostname. Refer to [Configure network access](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/network) for instructions. 

When configuring multiple hostnames, create and distribute TLS certificates for the secondary hostname in addition to the primary hostname. Refer to [TLS settings](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tls-settings) in the deployment configuration reference for additional information.

#### Enable Strict Transport Security Header

You can configure Terraform Enterprise to set the [Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) header by setting [TFE_TLS_ENFORCE](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tfe_tls_enforce) in the application environment.

~> **Note:** Once properly configured, the HSTS header cannot be disabled and will prevent clients from accessing your Terraform Enterprise domain via HTTP or HTTPS using a self-signed cert. We recommend only enabling this setting for production Terraform Enterprise deployments.

#### Disable Global Remote State Sharing

Terraform Enterprise allows site admins to enable [global remote state sharing](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/general#remote-state-sharing), which allows any workspace to access the state versions of any other workspace within the same organization. We recommend disabling this feature and relying on [controlled remote state access](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-controlled-remote-state-access-for-terraform-cloud-and-enterprise) if you need to share state between workspaces.

#### Treat Support Bundles with Care

Terraform Enterprise uses support bundles to share diagnostic information with HashiCorp support. Please note that support bundles may contain sensitive information from your Terraform Enterprise installation. You should not share them with untrusted parties and should delete them as soon as possible.

#### Update Terraform Enterprise Often

We release Terraform Enterprise updates each month. Updates may contain additional security features or fixes for existing security vulnerabilities, so we recommend establishing a process for periodically updating your Terraform Enterprise installation.

#### Subscribe to Terraform Enterprise Security Bulletins

We publish updates that address security vulnerabilities in HashiCorp products. You can find them in the Security category of [HashiCorp Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/security/).

We recommend that Terraform Enterprise infrastructure admins follow the [documented steps](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/about-hashicorp-security-updates/15330) to subscribe to email notifications or the RSS feed for Terraform Enterprise security updates.
