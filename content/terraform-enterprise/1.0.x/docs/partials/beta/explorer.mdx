<Note>

This feature is in beta. We recommend only using it non-production environments because updates during the beta phase may require you to destroy the explorer database. Running the explorer may increase the load on the Terraform Enterprise server in unexpected ways, resulting in slowdowns or outages.

Explorer on Terraform Enterprise only has access to data to the information available in the runs from Terraform Enterprise 1.0.0 and later.
You can provide feedback on this feature by selecting **Give Feedback** from the **Actions** menu or by contacting your account team.
