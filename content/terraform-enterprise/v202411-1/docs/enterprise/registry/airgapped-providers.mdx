# Publish Public Providers to an Airgapped Private Registry

This topic describes how to publish an official HashiCorp provider hosted in the public registry to a private registry in an airgapped environment.

## Introduction

Your Terraform Enterprise installation must be able to access the [public Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) to build workspaces that rely on official public HashiCorp providers. However, this is a problem if your Terraform Enterprise installation is in an airgapped environment without internet access.

To solve this, you can download the public provider and [re-upload it to your private registry](/terraform/enterprise/registry/publish-providers). There are a few differences in the workflow for re-uploading a public HashiCorp provider. In this example, you will download the AWS provider and re-upload it to your private registry. You can use the same workflow for [any official HashiCorp provider](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers?tier=official).

To re-upload a public HashiCorp provider to your private registry, complete the following steps.

## Download required files

Download the provider binary files for the provider, the `SHASUMS` file, and the `SHA256SUMS.72D7468F.sig` file. These files are available at [https://releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com). For this example, you can refer to the [AWS provider files](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-aws/5.14.0/) for more details. You will only re-upload the binaries for the `linux_amd64` architecture, but you can use this same process to re-upload multiple builds of the same provider.

First, download the `SHASUMS` file. This file contains a SHA256 checksum for each build of this specific provider version.

```shell-session
$ curl \
  https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-aws/5.14.0/terraform-provider-aws_5.14.0_SHA256SUMS \
  --output terraform-provider-aws_5.14.0_SHA256SUMS
```

Next, download the `SHA256SUMS.72D7468F.sig` file. This file is a GPG binary signature of the `SHA256SUMS` file. 

```shell-session
$ curl \
  https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-aws/5.14.0/terraform-provider-aws_5.14.0_SHA256SUMS.72D7468F.sig \
  --output terraform-provider-aws_5.14.0_SHA256SUMS.72D7468F.sig
```

Finally, download the `linux_amd64` build of the provider binary.

```shell-session
$ curl \
  https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-aws/5.14.0/terraform-provider-aws_5.14.0_linux_amd64.zip \
  --output terraform-provider-aws_5.14.0_linux_amd64.zip
```

## Create the provider

Re-upload the provider by following the guide in [Publishing a provider](/terraform/enterprise/registry/publish-providers#publishing-a-provider). There are _two differences_ that you need to make in this workflow:

- Do not sign the binary with your GPG key; [HashiCorp's public PGP key](https://www.hashicorp.com/.well-known/pgp-key.txt) has already signed it.
- Do not upload your public GPG key. Instead, use HashiCorp's public key. Terraform Enterprise version v202309-1 and newer includes the public key by default. The key ID is `34365D9472D7468F`. You can verify the ID by [importing the public key locally](/terraform/tutorials/cli/verify-archive#download-and-import-hashicorp-s-public-key).
