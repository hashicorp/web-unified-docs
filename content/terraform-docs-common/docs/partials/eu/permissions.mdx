In HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organizations, you manage user access through HCP groups. HCP roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform, and you can add additional fine-grained roles within HCP Terraform itself. To learn more about HCP roles, refer to [HCP group roles](#hcp-group-roles). To learn more about HCP Europe, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe).
