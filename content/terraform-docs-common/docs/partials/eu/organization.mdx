If you are in an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization, you create and administer an organization through the HCP platform. HCP Terraform inherits your organization and SSO settings from HCP, and you can further tweak your organization's settings in HCP Terraform.

To learn how to create and manage an organization in HCP, refer to [Organizations](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs). To learn more about HCP Europe, refer to the [HCP Europe documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe).
