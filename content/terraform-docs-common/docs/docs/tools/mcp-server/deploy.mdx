# Deploy the Terraform MCP server

The Terraform MCP (Model Context Protocol) server runs in a Docker container that you can deploy to either your local workstation or a remote instance. When running the server locally, start it in the default `stdio` mode. In this mode, the server communicates over standard input/output. When running the server on a remote instance, start the server in `streamable-http` mode so that you can communicate with the server using the Streamable HTTP transport.

@include 'beta.mdx'

## Overview

Complete the following steps to deploy the server.

### Standard IO transport

1. Enable MCP in your client
1. Install the server
1. Configure your client

### Streamable HTTP transport

1. Configure environment variables
1. Build the Docker image
1. Configure your client
1. Start the server

## Requirements


One of the following Docker distributions is required:

- Docker Engine v20.10.21+
- Docker Desktop v4.14.0+

Refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) for installation instructions.

The following MCP clients are supported:

- VS Code with CoPilot. Refer to the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) for installation instructions.
- Cursor. Refer to the [Cursor website](https://www.cursor.com) for more information.
- Anthropic Claude Desktop. Refer to the [Anthropic Claude Desktop documentation](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-for-desktop) for installation instructions.

## Enable MCP in your client

Refer to your client's documentation for instructions on enabling MCP:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers)
- [Anthropic Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

## Install the server

You can install the server using the following methods if you intend to run the server locally:

- Install the binary into your client. The binaries are available at [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-mcp-server/).
- Install from source into your client.

For remote installations, download the source to the remote and build the Docker image.

### Compiled binary

Refer to [Requirements](#requirements) for supported clients.

<Tab heading="VS Code">

To install the server so that it's available for all workspaces, add the following JSON block to your user setting JSON file:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "terraform": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can install the server in specific workspaces. Create an `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` directory of your workspace and add the following JSON block:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "terraform": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Claude Desktop, Amazon Q Developer and CLI">

Create an `mcp.json` file and add the following configuration:
 
```json
{
"mcpServers": {
  "servers": {
   "hcp-terraform": {
     "command": "docker",
     "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server:<version>"
       ]
     }
   }
 }
}

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Start or restart Docker to start the container using the standard transport.

### Install from source

You can pull the source from either the `latest` release version or pull from the `main` branch to install from source.

Latest:

```shell-session
$ go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/cmd/terraform-mcp-server@latest
```

Main:

```shell-session
$ go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/cmd/terraform-mcp-server@main
```

After pulling the image, add the following JSON block to your client and specify the path to the server binary in the `command` attribute:


```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "terraform": {
        "command": "/path/to/terraform-mcp-server",
        "args": ["stdio"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Start or restart Docker to start the container using the standard transport.

## Configure environment variables

If you intend to run the MCP server on a remote instance, log into the remote machine and specify the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TRANSPORT_MODE` | Set to `streamable-http` to enable HTTP transport | `stdio` |
| `TRANSPORT_HOST` | Host to bind the HTTP server | `0.0.0.0` |
| `TRANSPORT_PORT` | HTTP server port | `8080` |

## Build the Docker image 

You can download the source to your local machine or to a remote instance and build the server locally. 

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server.git
cd terraform-mcp-server
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
```

Use the image to run the server in `stdio` mode or to run it in `streamable-http` mode:

`stdio` mode:

```shell-session
$ docker run -i --rm terraform-mcp-server:dev
```

`streamable-http` mode:

```shell-session
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm -e MODE=streamabe-http terraform-mcp-server:dev
```

## Configure your MCP client

Complete the following steps if you are using Copilot in VS Code: 

1. Open the chat interface and choose **Agent** from the mode settings. 
1. Click the tools icon to verify that the Terraform MCP server tools are enabled.

Complete the following steps if you are using Cursor:

1. Open the chat pane and choose **Chat Settings** from the ellipses menu. 
1. Choose **Agent from the **Default new chat mode** drop-down menu.
1. Choose **MCP** from the **Cursor Settings** sidebar to verify that the Terraform MCP server tools are enabled.

Complete the following steps if you are using Claude Desktop:

1. Open the chat pane and choose the **search and tools** slider icon to the bottom left of the chat pane.
1. Click **terraform-mcp-server** to verify that all the tools are enabled.

## Next steps

After downloading the Terraform MCP server and connecting it to your client, you can begin prompting your model about your Terraform configuration code. Refer to [Prompt an AI model](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server/prompt) for more information.
