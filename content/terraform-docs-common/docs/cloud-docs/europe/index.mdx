# Use HCP Terraform in Europe

HashiCorp's product-as-a-service platform, [HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)](/hcp/docs), can manage infrastructure in Europe. With HCP Europe, your resources are hosted, managed, and billed separately to meet [European data residency requirements](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/privacy/hcp-data-privacy).

HCP Europe also hosts HCP Terraform in HCP Europe, which lets you manage Terraform resources in Europe with familiar workflows while adhering to European data and privacy regulations. To learn more, refer to [HCP EU region and data governance](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/eu).

To learn more about HCP Europe, refer to the [HCP Europe documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe).

## HCP Terraform in Europe differences

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization.

In HCP Europe, your account, organization, projects, and workspaces are separate from your HCP Terraform resources in other regions. HCP Terraform also calculates billing separately for Terraform resources in HCP Europe.

In HCP Europe, you administrate HCP Terraform through the HCP platform. HCP Terraform inherits the organization, projects, and groups of users that you set up in HCP.

In HCP Europe organizations, you configure the following in the HCP platform:

- [Organizations](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs)
- [Projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects)
- [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups)
- [Users](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users)
- [HCP organization and project roles for groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#roles-permissions)

HCP Europe organizations do not support **teams**, but you can manage user access and permissions through HCP **groups** and roles. You also can further refine group permissions in HCP Terraform at the organization, project, and workspace scope. To learn more, refer to [Set permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions).

## Get started

You must create a new HCP account and organization to use HCP Europe. You cannot connect or migrate existing HCP Terraform accounts or organizations to HCP Europe.

To get started with HCP Terraform in the EU region, sign up on the HCP Europe portal: <https://eu.cloud.hashicorp.com>.

To learn more about HCP Europe and creating a new account, refer to the [HCP Europe documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe). To learn about the available billing and plan options, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales).

## Constraints and limitations

The following features are not available in HCP Europe organizations in HCP Terraform:
- Using Flex or pay-as-you-go billing.
- Manually changing HCP Terraform plans. To learn about the available billing and plan options, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales).
- Using the third-party integrations for ServiceNow or the Kubernetes operator.
- Using the [`tf-migrate` CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/migrate) tool.
- Using [public registry namespaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations/public-namespace) to share private modules with other organizations.
- Setting [execution mode](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage#change-the-execution-mode) at the project level. Instead, set execution mode at the organization or workspace levels.
- HCP Terraform does not support [HCP service principals](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal).

To learn about the limitations of HCP Europe organizations on the HCP platform, refer to the [HCP documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe#constraints-and-limitations).
