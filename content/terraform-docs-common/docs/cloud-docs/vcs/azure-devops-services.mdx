# Set up the Azure DevOps Services VCS provider using OAuth

These instructions describe how to connect to `dev.azure.com` for VCS integration. Refer to the [VCS overview](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs) for information about other systems.

## Overview

Complete the following steps to connect to Azure DevOps Services VCS:

1. Enable third-party application access in Azure DevOps Services.
1. In HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise, create a new connection and get the callback URL.
1. Perform the following actions in your Microsoft Entra admin center:
    1. Create a new Microsoft Entra application.
    1. Provide the HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise callback URL.
    1. Retrieve the Microsoft Entra application ID, tenant ID, and tenant key.
1. Perform the following actions in HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise:
    1. Provide the Microsoft Entra application ID, tenant ID, and tenant key.
    1. Request VCS access.
4.  On your VCS, approve the access request from HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise.
5.  On your VCS, connect Azure DevOps Organization to the Microsoft Entra Application.


## Requirements

Only Azure DevOps connections that use the `dev.azure.com` domain are supported. If your Azure DevOps project uses the older `visualstudio.com` domain, you must migrate using the [steps in the Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2018/sep-10-azure-devops-launch#switch-existing-organizations-to-use-the-new-domain-name-url).

Configuring a new VCS provider requires permission to [manage VCS settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-vcs-settings) for the organization.

## Add a new VCS provider

Complete the following steps in HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise:

1.  Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the organization where you want to add the VCS provider.

2.  Choose **Settings** from the sidebar, then click **Providers**.

3.  Click **Add VCS Provider**. The **VCS Providers** page appears.

4.  Select **Azure DevOps** and then select **Azure DevOps Services** from the menu. The page moves to the next step.

Leave this page open in a browser tab. You will copy values from this page into Azure DevOps in the next step, and in later steps you will continue configuring HCP Terraform.

## Create a new Microsoft Entra application

Complete the following steps in your Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. In a new browser tab, login to your [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
1. Open the **Applications** drop-down menu, then click **App registrations**. If you have access to multiple Entra tenants, switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
1. Complete the following fields and enable the following options with the corresponding values currently displayed in your HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise browser tab:

    | Field name       | Value                                                                                                      |
    | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Application Name | HCP Terraform (`<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME>`)                                                                 |
    | Redirect URI     | Choose **Web** from the drop-down and enter `https://app.terraform.io/<YOUR CALLBACK URL>` in the text box |

1. Click **Register** to create the app.

1. Once the app is registered, click **API permissions** under the **Manage** section from the application overview.
1. Click **Azure DevOps**, then add **vso.code** and **vso.code_status** permissions.

1. Click **Certificates and secrets**, then click the **Client secrets** tab.
1. Click **New client secret** and complete the instructions when prompted to create a client secret.
1. Click **Overview** and leave this page open in a browser tab. In the next step, you will copy and paste the unique **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Client Secret** from this page.

## Set up your provider

Complete the follwoing actions in HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise:

1. (Optional) Enter a **Name** for this VCS connection.
1. Enter your Azure DevOps Services application's **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Client Secret**. Get these values from the application's details in the open browser tab described in [Create a new Microsoft Entra application](#create-a-new-microsoft-entra-application).
1. Click **Connect and continue**. This action opens a page in Azure DevOps Services that prompts you to authorize the app.
1. Click **Accept**. You are redirected back to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise.

If you receive a 404 error from Azure DevOps Services, verify that your callback URL is configured correctly.

## Configure advanced settings (optional)

The following HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise settings are optional.

-   **Scope of VCS Provider**. You can configure which workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> or Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> can use repositories from this VCS provider. By default the **All Projects** option is selected, meaning this VCS provider is available to be used by all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the organization.
-   **Set up SSH Keypair**. Most organizations do not need to add an SSH key. However, if the organization repositories include Git submodules that can only be accessed over SSH, an SSH key can be added along with the OAuth credentials. You can add or update the SSH key at a later time.

If you don't need to configure the advanced settings, click **Skip and Finish**. HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise directs you to the VCS provider page, which now includes your new Azure DevOps Services client.

### Limit the scope of the VCS provider

Complete the following steps if you need to Limit the scope of this VCS provider:

1. Select the **Selected Projects** option and use the text field that appears to search for and select projects to enable. All current and future workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> for any selected projects can use repositories from this VCS Provider.

2.  Click the **Update VCS Provider** button to save your selections.

### Create an SSH keypair

HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise only use SSH keypairs to clone Git submodules. All other Git operations use HTTPS.

Do not use your personal SSH key to connect Azure DevOps Services. Generate a new keypair or use an existing key reserved for service access.

The following steps require you to provide HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise with a private key. Terraform does not display the text of the key after you enter it, but it retains the text and uses it when authenticating to Azure DevOps Services.

Protect this private key carefully. Someone can use it to push code to the repositories you use to manage your infrastructure. Take note of your organization's policies for protecting important credentials and be sure to follow them.

1.  On a secure workstation, create an SSH keypair that HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterrpise can use to connect to Azure DevOps Services. Refer to your operating system documentation for details. The following example uses the `ssh-keygen` command to create a `service_terraform` file with the private key, and a `service_terraform.pub` file with the public key:

    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f "/Users/<NAME>/.ssh/service_terraform" -C "service_terraform_enterprise"`

     This SSH key **must have an empty passphrase**. HCP Terraform cannot use SSH keys that require a passphrase.

1. Log into the Azure DevOps Services account you want HCP Terraform to act as.
1. Navigate to the SSH Keys settings page.
1. Add a new SSH key and paste the value of the SSH public key you created in step 1.
1. In HCP Terraform, open the **Add VCS Provider** page.
1. Provide the text of the **SSH private key** you created in step 1, then click **Add SSH Key**.

## Connect Azure DevOps Organization to the Microsoft Entra Application.

Ensure that the Azure DevOps organization you intend to link with HCP Terraform is connected to the correct Microsoft Entra app created in Step 2 by following these [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/connect-organization-to-azure-ad?view=azure-devops).

## Next steps

After configuring Azure DevOps Services access for HCP Terraform, you can create Terraform workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> or Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->based on your organization's repositories.

### Migrate existing workspaces to connect to ADO Organization with the new MS Entra App

If you need to migrate existing workspaces to connect to ADO organization, go to the HCP Terraform workspaces associated with the Azure DevOps organization via legacy OAuth application, and update the VCS settings to use the new VCS provider created in Step 3.
