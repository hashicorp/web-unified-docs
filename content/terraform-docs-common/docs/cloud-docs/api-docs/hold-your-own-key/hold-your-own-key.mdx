# Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) API Reference
Hold Your Own Key, or HYOK, lets you authenticate your own Key Management System (KMS) to encrypt HCP Terraform state and plan data. HCP Terraform agents do the actual work of securing and encrypting artifacts, so neither your key (from your KMS), nor unencrypted secrets need to be uploaded to HCP Terraform, and no out-of-network traffic needs to hit your KMS.

-> **Note:** Once enabled, HYOK cannot be disabled.
