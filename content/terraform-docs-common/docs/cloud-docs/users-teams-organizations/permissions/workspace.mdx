# Workspace permissions

Workspace-level permissions apply to a specific workspace and control what users can do within that workspace.

## Background

If you are in an HCP Terraform organization, you can manage user access and permissions through teams. Refer to the following topics for information about setting permissions in HCP Terraform:
- [Set permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions)
- [Organization permissions reference](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization)
- [Project permissions reference](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/project)
- [Effective permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#effective-permissions) provides information about competing permissions.

## Workspace roles and permissions

A role is a preselected set of permissions that you can assign to a team<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu --> or group<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->.

The following table shows the permissions granted by each workspace role. Each role builds upon the previous level, with **Admin** granting the most comprehensive access.

| Permission category | Permission name | [Admin](#workspace-admin) | [Write](#workspace-write) | [Plan](#workspace-plan) | [Read](#workspace-read) |

### Workspace admin

Much like the owners team has full control over an organization, each workspace has a special **Admin** permissions set that grants full control over the workspace. Members of a team with admin permissions on a workspace are sometimes called "workspace admins" for that workspace.

Admin permissions include the highest level of general permissions for the workspace. There are also some permissions that are only available to workspace admins, which generally involve changing the workspace's settings or setting access levels for other teams.

Workspace admins have all other [workspace permissions](#workspace-roles-and-permissions), as well as the ability to do the following:

- Read and write workspace settings, such as general settings, notification configurations, and run triggers.
- Set or remove workspace permissions for visible teams. Workspace admins cannot view or manage teams with the [**Secret**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams/manage#team-visibility) visibility option enabled unless they are also organization owners.
- Delete the workspace
  - Depending on the [organization's settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#general), workspace admins may only be able to delete the workspace if it is not actively managing infrastructure. Refer to [Deleting a Workspace With Resources Under Management](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#deleting-a-workspace-with-resources-under-management) for details.

### Workspace write

The **Write** permission set is for people who do most of the day-to-day work of provisioning and modifying managed infrastructure. Write access grants the following workspace permissions:

- Plan and apply workspace runs.
- Read and write the workspace has access to.
- Read and write to the state of a workspace.
- Lock and unlock the workspace.
- Download Sentinel mocks.

Refer to [Workspace roles and permissions](#workspace-roles-and-permissions) for details about specific permissions.

### Workspace plan

The **Plan** permission set is for people who might propose changes to managed infrastructure, but whose proposed changes should be approved before they are applied. Plan access grants the following workspace permissions:

- Plan workspace runs.
- Read variables the workspace has access to.
- Read the state of a workspace.

Refer to [Workspace roles and permissions](#workspace-roles-and-permissions) for details about specific permissions.

### Workspace read

The **Read** permission set is for people who need to view information about the status and configuration of managed infrastructure in order to do their jobs, but aren't responsible for maintaining that infrastructure. Read access grants the following workspace permissions:

- Read workspace runs.
- Read variables the workspace has access to.
- Read the state of a workspace.

Refer to [Workspace roles and permissions](#workspace-roles-and-permissions) for details about specific permissions.

### Workspace custom role

Custom permission sets let you assign a custom role with fine-grained permissions. Creating a custom role lets you create a task-focused permission set with a tighter control of sensitive information.

You can use custom permissions to assign any of the permissions listed under [workspace roles and permissions](#workspace-roles-and-permissions), except admin-only permissions.

## Run access

The following table summarizes the available run access permissions for the workspace.

| Permission name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| [Read](#run-read) | View information about workspace runs. |
| [Plan](#run-plan) | Queue Terraform plans in the workspace. |
| [Apply](#run-apply) | Approve and apply Terraform plans in the workspace. |

### Read <a id="run-read"></a>

Allows users to view information about remote Terraform runs. Users can view run history, the status of runs, configuration versions associated with a run, and the log output of each stage of a run. Refer to [Run states and stages](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/run/states) for more information.

### Plan <a id="run-plan"></a>

Allows users to read, queue, and comment on Terraform plans in a workspace. Regular plans require approval from a user with permission to apply runs.

### Apply <a id="run-apply"></a>

Allows users to read, plan, approve, and apply Terraform plans. Granting this permission allows team members to change real infrastructure. 

## Variable access

The following table summarizes the available permissions for accessing workspace variables.

| Permission name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| [No access](#variable-no-access) | No access to workspace variables. |
| [Read](#variable-read) | View workspace variables and environment variables. |
| [Read and write](#variable-read-write) | Edit workspace variables and environment variables. |

### No access <a id="variable-no-access"></a>

No access is granted to the values of Terraform variables and environment variables for the workspace.

### Read <a id="variable-read"></a>
Allows users to view the values of Terraform variables and environment variables for the workspace. Note that variables marked as sensitive are write-only and can't be viewed by any user.

### Read and write <a id="variable-read-write"></a>

Allows users to read and edit the values of variables in the workspace. 


## State access

The following table summarizes the available state access permissions for the workspace.

| Permission name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| [No access](#state-no-access) | No access to workspace state. |
| [Read outputs only](#state-read-outputs) | Access public outputs from workspace state. |
| [Read](#state-read) | Read complete state files from the workspace. |
| [Read and write](#state-read-write) | Create new state versions in the workspace. |

### No access <a id="state-no-access"></a>

No access is granted to the state file from the workspace.

### Read outputs only <a id="state-read-outputs"></a>

Allows users to access values in the workspace's most recent Terraform state that have been explicitly marked as public outputs. Refer to [Define outputs to expose module data](/terraform/language/parameterize#define-outputs-to-expose-module-data) to learn more.

Configuration authors often use output values to interface with other workspaces that manage loosely-coupled collections of infrastructure. Making output values readable lets people who have no direct responsibility for the managed infrastructure in one workspace still indirectly use some of its functions in their workspaces.

This permission is required to use the following features:

 - Call the [`/state-versions` API endpoint](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/state-version-outputs) 
 - Run the [`terraform output` command](/terraform/cli/commands/output)
 - Use the [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/terraform/language/state/remote-state-data) against the workspace.

### Read <a id="state-read"></a>

Allows users to read complete state files from the workspace. State files are useful for identifying infrastructure changes over time, but often contain sensitive information. This permission implies permission to read outputs only.

### Read and write <a id="state-read-write"></a>

Allows users to read and directly create new state versions in the workspace. This permission is required for performing local runs when the workspace's execution mode is set to **Local**. 

This permission is also required to use any of the [Terraform CLI's state manipulation and maintenance commands](/terraform/cli/state) against this workspace, including `terraform import`, `terraform taint`, and the various `terraform state` subcommands.

### Other controls

The following table summarizes additional control permissions for the workspace.

| Permission name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| [Download Sentinel mocks](#download-sentinel-mocks) | Download data from runs for developing Sentinel policies. |
| [Lock/unlock workspace](#lock-unlock-workspace) | Manually lock the workspace to prevent runs. |
| [Manage workspace Run Tasks](#manage-workspace-run-tasks) | Associate or dissociate run tasks with the workspace. |

### Download Sentinel mocks

Allows users to download data from runs in the workspace in a format that you can use for developing Sentinel policies. This run data from Sentinel mocks is detailed and may contain unredacted sensitive information.

### Lock/unlock workspace

Allows users to manually lock the workspace to temporarily prevent runs. When a workspace's execution mode is set to **Local**, you must grant this permission so that team members can perform local CLI runs using the workspace's state.

### Manage workspace Run Tasks

Allows users to associate or dissociate run tasks with the workspace. HCP Terraform creates run tasks at the organization level, where you can manually associate or dissociate them with specific workspaces.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

## HCP group roles

In an HCP Europe organization, you manage user access through groups. To learn how to set up groups and assign users to them in HCP, refer to [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). To learn more about HCP Terraform in Europe, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe).

You can assign permissions to HCP groups in two ways:

- [HCP roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions#set-workspace-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations) - You can assign HCP roles to groups in the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP), and these roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
- [HCP Terraform roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions#set-workspace-level-roles) - Assign additional permissions at the organization, project, and workspace level to further refine group access in HCP Terraform.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was set by an HCP or HCP Terraform role.

The following table shows which workspace-level permissions each HCP role automatically grants in HCP Terraform:

| Permission Category | HCP Terraform workspace permission | Admin | Contributor | Viewer |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| [Run access](#run-access) | [Read runs](#run-read) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| | [Plan runs](#run-plan) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| | [Apply runs](#run-apply) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Variable access](#variable-access) | [Read variables](#variable-read) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| | [Read and write variables](#variable-read-write) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [State access](#state-access) | [Read outputs only](#state-read-outputs) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| | [Read state](#state-read) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| | [Read and write state](#state-read-write) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Other controls](#other-controls) | [Download Sentinel mocks](#download-sentinel-mocks) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| | [Lock/unlock workspace](#lock-unlock-workspace) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| | [Manage workspace Run Tasks](#manage-workspace-run-tasks) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
