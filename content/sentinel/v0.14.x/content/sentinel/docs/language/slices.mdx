# Language: Slices

Slices are an efficient way to create a substring or sublist from an
existing string or list, respectively.

The syntax for creating a slice is:

```sentinel
a[low : high]
```

`low` is the lowest index to slice from. The resulting slice includes
the value at `low`. `high` is the index to slice to. The resulting slice
will not include the value at `high`. The length of the resulting list
or string is always `high - low`.

```sentinel
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = a[1:4] // [2, 3, 4]

a = "hello"
b = a[1:4] // "ell"
```
