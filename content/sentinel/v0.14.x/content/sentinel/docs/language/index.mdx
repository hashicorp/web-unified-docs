# Sentinel Language

Sentinel policies are written using the Sentinel language. This language
is easy to learn and easy to write. You can learn the Sentinel language
and be productive within an hour. Learning Sentinel doesn't require any
formal programming experience.

This language guide will contain many details that are not necessary to
be productive with Sentinel or are targeted to those who are looking for
exact information about the language (such as what types of line endings are
allowed). You can safely ignore these sentences.

You may also view the
[official language specification](/sentinel/language/spec)
This is a specific and detailed document on the syntax and behavior of
the language primarily intended for implementation creators and to disambiguate
the language.

## Simplest Example

The example below is about the simplest practical example of Sentinel.
It is reasonable to imagine this as a realistic policy. This shows that
in most cases, Sentinel will be extremely simple:

```sentinel
main = rule { request.method is "GET" and request.headers contains "X-Key" }
```

## Files

Sentinel policies are single files that end in the `.sentinel` file extension.
There is currently no built-in mechanism to Sentinel for merging multiple
files. This is purposefully done to make Sentinel policies easy to submit
to systems that support Sentinel policies.

Sentinel policy files must be UTF-8 encoded and can end in both
Unix (LF) or Windows (CRLF) line breaks. When running the
[auto-formatter](#),
line endings will always use Unix line breaks.

## Ordering

Sentinel policies are executed top-down. For example:

```sentinel
a = 1      // a = 1 here
b = a + 1  // b = 2 here
a = 3      // a = 3, b = 2
```

In this example, the value of `a` and `b` is shown at each line. Since Sentinel
executes values top-down, the final value of `a` is 3 and `b` is 2. `b` _does
not_ become 4.

## Main

Sentinel expects there to be a `main` [rule](/sentinel/language/rules).
The value of this rule is the result of the entire policy.

If the result of `main` is true, the policy passes. If the value is anything
else (false or a non-boolean value), the policy fails. The exact meaning
of what happens a policy passes or fails is dependent on the host system.

## More Complex Example

The simple example above is a full working example. In our experience with
Sentinel, many policies can be representing using this simple form. However,
to show more features of the language, a more complex example is shown below.
This example is also a realistic example of what Sentinel may be used for.

```sentinel
import "units"

memory = func(job) {
  result = 0
  for job.groups as g {
    for g.tasks as t {
      result += t.resources.memory else 0
    }
  }

  return result
}

main = rule {
  memory(job) < 1 * units.gigabyte
}
```
