# Installing Import Plugins

Import plugins are installed by configuring the Sentinel-enabled application
with the path to the plugin, the name of the import, and any arguments needed
to launch the plugin.

-> **Not all Sentinel-enabled applications support plugins.** Please refer
to the documentation of the specific Sentinel-enabled application. Some
applications disable plugins for security reasons. For those that do
enable plugins, the method to configure plugins may vary.

## Installing Plugins

Sentinel plugins are standalone executables. The Sentinel-enabled application
launches these plugins and communicates with them via
[RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call). To install
a plugin, the first step is to download the plugin executable for the
platform that the Sentinel-enabled application is running on.

After downloading the plugin, you must configure the Sentinel-enabled
application. This may be via a configuration file, an API call, or some
other method. Please refer to the application-specific documentation for
more details.

Sentinel imports are configured with the following settings:

* `name` (required) - The name of the import within Sentinel policies.
  For example, `import "foo"`, where "foo" is the import name.
  This is often specified as the key to the configuration.

* `path` (required) - This is the path to the plugin executable.

* `args` (optional) - This is a list of arguments to pass to the executable when
  launched. By default, no arguments are given.

* `env` (optional) - This is a set of environment variables to expose to
  the plugin. By default, the same environment variables given to the
  application are inherited by the plugin. This key can be used to add
  additional variables.

* `config` (optional) - This is a map of key/value pairs for configuring
  the plugin. Please refer to the plugin documentation for available
  configuration options. Some plugins may not require any configuration.

After configuring the plugin, you may have to restart the application
for it to become available.

## Debugging Plugins

Sentinel logs when it launches, configures, closes a plugin and more.

To debug issues with a plugin, please refer to the logs of the
Sentinel-enabled application. You may have to configure the application
to show Sentinel logs. Please refer to the application-specific documentation.
