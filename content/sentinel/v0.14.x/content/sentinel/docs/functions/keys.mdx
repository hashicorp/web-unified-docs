# Builtin Function: keys

The built-in function `keys` returns the keys of a map.

`keys` called on any value other than a map or undefined will result
in an immediate error.

The returned keys are not in any specified order since maps do not have an order.

Examples:

```sentinel
data = { "a": 2, "b": 3 }
keys(data)       // ["b", "a"]
```
