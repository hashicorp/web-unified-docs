# Extending Sentinel: Static Imports

Static imports allow you to write imports that use static data files. This can
provide methods of consuming data in ways that are not available via
[modules](./modules) or [plugins](./plugins).

### Configuring a Static Import

The [configuration page](/sentinel/configuration#static-imports) details how to
configure static imports.

### Usage

Using a static import is not that different to using a plugin or module. The
import must first be introduced to the policy via an import statement.

```sentinel
import "people"
```

From here, the static data can be used throughout the policy as you would any
normal Sentinel value.

```sentinel
admins = filter people as person {
  person.role is "Admin"
}
```

One differentiator for static imports is that you can directly reference the
import without the use of selectors. For example, to print the value;

```sentinel
print(people)
```

This is due to the static data being directly loaded and converted into a
Sentinel value, ready for use. Static imports, like modules and plugins, cannot
be assigned a new value.

#### Namespaces

One advantage of static imports over other import types, is the ability to
access nested data directly via a namespaced import. For instance, let us
consider a static import with the following nested data structure:

```json
{
  "dogs": [
    "Labrador",
    "Golden Retriever"
  ],
  "cats": [
    "Birman",
    "Korat"
  ]
}
```

The list of dogs would normally be accessed through a selector expression, such
as:

```sentinel playground
import "animals"

main = rule {
  length(animals.dogs) is 2
}
```

However, the data can also be accessed directly at import time:

```sentinel playground
import "animals/dogs" as dogs

main = rule {
  length(dogs) is 2
}
```

Although the above example is simple in nature, any nested map structure can
be accessed this way. Note, lists cannot be indexed from the import path.
