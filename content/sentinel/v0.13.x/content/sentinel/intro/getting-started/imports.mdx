# Imports

Imports enable Sentinel to access external data and functions.

Sentinel ships with a set of [standard imports](/sentinel/imports).
Standard imports are available by default to every Sentinel policy. Note that
the application embedding Sentinel may whitelist or blacklist the available
set of imports.

To use an import, use the `import` statement. Then, access data and
functions on the import using the import name followed by a period and
the field you want to access. The example below checks whether the request
path starts with a prefix. Assume that `request_path` is available.

```sentinel
import "strings"

main = rule { strings.has_prefix(request_path, "/admin") }
```

## External Data

The true power in imports is their ability to reference external data.
Imports can be added to a Sentinel-enabled application through
[plugins](/sentinel/extending). This enables any Sentinel-enabled
application to make policy decision based on any source of data.

This ability allows the policy system to enforce almost any necessary
organizational policy, since the ability of a policy isn't restricted
purely to the embedding application's data model.

For example, policies in [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) can
access data in [Consul](https://www.consul.io) to determine attributes
of a policy. In the example below, we use a hypothetical Consul import:

```sentinel
import "consul"

main = rule {
    job.tasks[0].resources.memory <= int(consul.get("policy/nomad/max-memory"))
}
```

In this example, a Nomad job's memory usage is limited to the value of
a Consul key/value item. By simply changing a Consul KV entry, policy
can be changed. Imports can do anything, you can [write your own import plugins](/sentinel/extending)
to extend Sentinel.

Next, we'll learn how to
[test policies](/sentinel/intro/getting-started/testing)
to ensure our policy logic is correct.
