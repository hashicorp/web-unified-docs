# Install Sentinel CLI

Sentinel is a policy framework that is embedded in the enterprise versions of
HashiCorp tools. The policies you write are deployed to these applications and
enforced there.

The Sentinel CLI is a command-line interface for local development and testing.
For the getting started guide, we'll use the CLI to learn how to write policies
for Sentinel-enabled applications. The Sentinel CLI is distributed as a [binary
package](/sentinel/downloads) for all supported platforms and architectures.

## Installation Instructions

To install the Sentinel CLI, find the [appropriate package](/sentinel/downloads) for your
system and download it. The CLI is packaged as a zip archive.

After downloading Sentinel, unzip the package. The CLI runs as a single binary
named `sentinel`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and
Sentinel will still function.

The final step is to make sure that the `sentinel` binary is available on the `PATH`.
See [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux)
for instructions on setting the PATH on Linux and Mac.
[This page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows)
contains instructions for setting the PATH on Windows.

## Verifying the Installation

After installing the Sentinel CLI, verify the installation worked by opening a
new terminal session and checking that the `sentinel` binary is available. By
executing `sentinel`, you should see help output similar to the following:

```
$ sentinel
Usage: sentinel [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:
    apply      Execute a policy and output the result
    fmt        Format Sentinel policy to a canonical format
    test       Test policies
    version    Prints the Sentinel version
```

If you get an error that the binary could not be found, then your `PATH`
environment variable was not setup properly. Please go back and ensure that your
`PATH` variable contains the directory where Sentinel was installed.

Otherwise, the CLI is installed and ready to go. Let's celebrate by [writing our
first policy!](/sentinel/intro/getting-started/first-policy)
