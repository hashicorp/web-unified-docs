# Sentinel CLI Configuration File Syntax

The Sentinel CLI's configuration file can be used to control the behavior
of the simulator during [`apply`](/sentinel/commands/apply) and
[`test`](/sentinel/commands/test) operations.

## Usage

The configuration file is used in different ways depending on what operation you
are trying to execute.

### Apply

When using `sentinel apply`, supply the configuration file by using the
`-config=FILE` flag, where `FILE` is the path to the configuration file. The
default is `sentinel.json`.

See the [apply command](/sentinel/commands/apply) reference for more
details.

### Test

When using sentinel test, each file matching `test/<policy>/*.json` is a
configuration file representing a single test case, where `<policy>` is the name
of the policy being tested. Configure assertions for each [test
case](#test-cases) using the test section.

See the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test) reference for more details.

## Configuration File Reference

The format of the configuration file is JSON. The available keys are:

- `mock` - A map of mock import data.
- `imports` - A map of available imports via [import plugins](/sentinel/extending).
- `global` - Data that is inserted into the global scope.
- `param` - Values for parameters defined in the policy.
- `test` - Test cases for the [test command](/sentinel/command/test).

### Mock Imports

Mock imports allow running a policy with an
[import](/sentinel/concept/import) that you may not have access to or is
too difficult to run. For example, it can be easier to mock data for [Terraform
Enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/sentinel/index.html)
locally instead of having to run a workspace through a plan/policy check cycle.

Mock imports are specified in the `mock` key, as a map to mock data, keyed by
the import name that you want to mock. For example, if you wanted to mock the
`time` import, you could create an entry with the `time` key pointing to the
data you want to mock.

The data can take one of two forms:

#### Mocking static data

Static data can be mocked directly by supplying a JSON object as the mock data.

Example:

```json
{
  "mock": {
    "time": {
      "now": {
        "hour": 9,
        "minute": 42
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass:

```sentinel
import "time"

main = time.now.hour == 9
```

#### Mocking with Sentinel code

There are some Sentinel types that static JSON data cannot mock, such as
functions, and maps that don't have string keys. To mock this data, you can use
a Sentinel file itself. In this case, the parameter to your import key is the
file with the Sentinel code in it, relative to the current working directory in
the event of `apply`, or relative to the configuration file location in the
event of `test`.

Note that `main` is not required in a mock data file.

Example:

```json
{
  "mock": {
    "foo": "mock-foo.sentinel"
  }
}
```

`mock-foo.sentinel` would contain:

```sentinel
bar = func() {
	return "baz"
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass:

```sentinel
import "foo"

main = foo.bar() == "baz"
```

### Imports

Imports allow you to run a real [import plugin](/sentinel/extending)
with a policy. The `sentinel` binary will launch the plugin, connect to it,
configure it, and execute it as needed by the policy.

Note the difference between this and mock imports above is that this
configuration specifies real import plugins to execute. The mock data
fakes an import with static data.

Imports are specified by the `import` key. The value of this is a map
where the key is the name of the import and the value is another map with
configuration about that import. The configuration map has the following keys:

- `path` (string, required) - Path to the import plugin executable.
- `args` (list of string, optional) - A list of arguments to pass to the
  executable when starting it.
- `env` (map of string to string, optional) - A set of environmental variables
  to set when launching the plugin.
- `config` (map, optional) - Configuration for the plugin itself. This is
  specific to each individual plugin. Please reference the documentation for
  the plugin for more information.

Example:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "time": {
      "path": "/path/to/sentinel-import-time",
      "config": { "fixed_time": 1504155600 }
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass assuming
the import configuration is valid:

```sentinel
import "time"

main = time.now.day == 31
```

### Global

Global data is injected directly into the global scope of the policy.
This can be used to simulate global data that may be injected by a
Sentinel-enabled application.

Global data is specified by the `global` key. The value is a map of
variables to inject directly into the running policy.

Example:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "time": {
      "now": {
        "day": 31
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass. Notice
that we don't have to do any `import`. The values of `global` are
injected directly into the global scope.

```sentinel
main = time.now.day == 31
```

### Parameters

The `param` section allows you to supply values for the
[parameters](/sentinel/language/parameters) found in a policy. Values
entered here will satisfy required parameters in a policy, in addition to
override any defaults. Note that any of the manual parameter value methods
supported by `sentinel apply` will override the values set here.

```json
{
  "param": {
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

### Test Cases

Test cases specify the test cases for the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test).

Tests are specified by the `test` key. The value of this is a map of
string to boolean. The key is the name of a rule and the value is the
expected value of that rule. If a rule is not specified, than any value is
allowed.

Example:

```json
{
  "test": {
    "main": true,
    "valid_day": false
  }
}
```

For the policy:

```sentinel
valid_day = rule { 2 < 1 } # This is just an example!
main = rule { not valid_day }
```
