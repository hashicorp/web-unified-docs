# Builtin Function: length

The built-in function `length` returns the length of a collection or string.

The length of a string is the number of bytes in the string. It is not
necessarilly the number of characters. The length of a collection is the
number of elements in that collection. The length of
[undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined) is `undefined`.

Examples:

```sentinel
length("foo")              // 3
length([1, 2, 3, 4])       // 4
length({ "key": "value" }) // 1
```
