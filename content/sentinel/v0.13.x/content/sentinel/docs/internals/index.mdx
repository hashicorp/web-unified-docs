# Sentinel Internals

This section covers the internals of Sentinel and explains how evaluation
occurs, plugins are executed, etc. The goal of this section is to remove
any notion of "magic" from Sentinel to allow you to trust and understand what
Sentinel is doing.

-> **Note:** Knowledge of Sentinel internals is not required to use Sentinel.
If you aren't interested in the internals of Sentinel, you may safely skip this
section.
