# Sentinel Runtime Release Notes

These are the release notes for the Sentinel runtime.

Each version of the runtime is released with a corresponding version of
[Sentinel CLI](/sentinel/commands). To download the CLI, see the [downloads
page](/sentinel/downloads).

Sentinel integrations and embedded runtimes may not always have the latest
version installed, depending on the product's individual release cycle. For more
information, contact the support team for your specific integration.

BUG FIXES:

- `config`: An issue with certain identifiers being treated as incorrectly invalid
  has been resolved. 

## 0.21.0 (March 8, 2023)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- `lang/ast`: `is empty` and `is not empty` are now treated as `ast.UnaryExpr`
  expressions, with `ast.IsEmptyExpr` being removed. 
- `lang/ast`: You can now assert if a value is defined or not using the `is defined`
  and `is not defined` syntax. 

FEATURES:

- `config`: Parameter values can now be provided for individual policies within
  a policy block. 

## 0.20.0 (February 16, 2023)

ENHANCEMENTS:

- `cmd/testcmd`: Allows sentinel tests to run concurrently by default. Sequential style testing can
  be enabled by running with the `-maxConcurrency=1` option. 
- `cmd/testcmd`: Allows sentinel test command to timeout after a certain duration. This can be provided
  by the user or will default to 5 minutes. 
- `cmd/apply`: The policy enforcement level is now included in the JSON output. 
- `lang/ast`: Functions can now be declared as named statements, providing
  a safer function declaration. 

BREAKING CHANGES:

- `cmd/apply`: Policies provided directly to the apply command will now default their enforcement
  level to `advisory`, aligning with the `policy` configuration block. 
- `sentinel`: JSON results will no longer return `allowed_failure` or `can_override` fields. 
- `sentinel/result`: A new package has been added which provides additional methods to return
  supplemental data about the evaluation result. 

## 0.19.5 (February 9, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/localast`: The `SelectorExpr` will correctly rewrite `X`. 

## 0.19.4 (February 8, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

BREAKING CHANGES:

- `config`: Attempts to override a standard import with a custom import will
  now be met with an error. 
- `imports`: All plugin imports now return `sdk.Plugin` instead of `sdk.Import`,
  as per the SDK update to v0.4.0. 

ENHANCEMENTS:

- `runtime/importer`: An `Import` and `ImportInstance` interface have been
  added to improve the import capabilities. 
- `runtime/importer`: The `Importer` interface now returns a `Import` interface
  instead of a `sdk.Import`. 
- `lang/semantic`: The Import Assignment semantic check uses the AST walker. 
- `lang/ast`: Added an AST Walker so the AST rewriter does not need to be used for basic AST tasks. 

FEATURES:

- `config`: Configuration syntax now allows for configuration of imports within
  the standard library. 
- `config`: A new configuration syntax for defining modules and plugins is now
  available.

## 0.18.6 (February 2, 2022)

NOTES:

- This release changes lower-level components that are used to manage policies within HashiCorp's Sentinel Integrations. There are no user-facing changes.

## 0.18.5 (January 14, 2022)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `runtime/initwd`: Changed the sum algorithm used during remote installation from `md5` to `sha256` to reduce chance of collision. 

## 0.18.4 (July 20, 2021)

FEATURES:

- `imports/static`: Improved handling of struct tags when performing encoding, allowing `-` to mark as ignored.

- `imports/json`: Fixed an issue where empty maps where failing when passed at any level to `marshal`. 

## 0.18.0 (March 25, 2021)

FEATURES:

- `imports/http`: Added support for POST actions within the `http` import
  through addition of the `post` function. Additionally, support for adding
  a body to the `request` object has been added via `with_body`. 

## 0.17.4 (February 2, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/format`: Fixed a nesting issue with the rule printer where nesting
  state leaks were leading to all collection values eventually being truncated,
  regardless of their nesting level. 

## 0.17.3 (January 15, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/initwd`: Fixed an issue where local file installation failed on Windows
  when using `sentinel test`. 

## 0.17.2 (January 13, 2021)

  `sentinel test`. 

## 0.17.1 (January 7, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

- `cmd/test`: Fixed an issue where hard-coded path separator caused `sentinel
  test` issues in Windows. 

## 0.17.0 (January 5, 2021)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **Map Expression** `map`. A new quantifier expression, `map` has been added.
  `map` takes a collection and applies an operation to each element in the
  collection, returning a list of results with the resulting values. 
- **Emptiness checks** `is empty` and `is not empty`. Two new expressions,
  `is empty` and `is not empty` have been added. As they are aliases to the
  `length` built-in, only `string`, `map`, `list` or `undefined` is
  supported. 
- **Comparable maps** Maps (the data type) are now comparable. Maps are equal if
  they are of equal length and both their corresponding keys and values are
  comparable and equal. 
- **Rich Return Types** Rules can now process and return non-boolean data.
  Scalar, list, and map types are supported. When non-boolean values are used,
  the presence of a non-zero or non-zero-length `main` rule determines policy
  failure. More details can be found on
  https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language#main. 

FEATURES:

- **CLI**: `sentinel apply` and `sentinel test` now have options for JSON
  output. For more details, see the CLI documentation.
- `imports/base64`: Added a new import, `base64`, to assist with encoding and
  decoding base64 strings.

## 0.16.1 (October 21, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/eval`: Fixed an issue where `contains` to ensure any instance of `undefined` would correctly result in `undefined`. 
- `runtime/eval`: Fixed an issue in `any` and `all` expressions to ensure correct boolean logic when dealing with a collection containing `undefined`. 
- `imports`: Fixed an issue where import processes were not killed, which caused non-graceful closures for the clients. 
- `lang/scanner`: Fixed an issue where inline `#` style comments were not being consumed. 

## 0.16.0 (October 14, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- `cmd/doc`: Removal of the deprecated `sentinel doc` command. 
- `sentinel`: Replace `whitelist` and `blacklist` with `allowlist` and `denylist`, as per inclusive language changes. 

FEATURES:

- `imports/version`: Added a new import, `version`, which supplies helpers for dealing with semantic versioning. 
- `cmd/apply`: Added an `HCL` based configuration file, which will eventually deprecate the legacy `JSON` configuration. 
- `cmd/apply`: Added support for download remote policies and modules. 
- `cmd/test`: Added support for downloading remote test modules. 
- `cmd/apply`: Added support for evaluating a policy based on it's key within the configuration. 
- `cmd/apply`: Added support for running all policies in a configuration by default. 

## 0.15.6 (July 7, 2020)

NOTES:

- This release changes lower-level components that are used to manage policies within HashiCorp's Sentinel Integrations. There are no user-facing changes.

## 0.15.5 (May 20, 2020)

NOTES:

- This release changes lower-level components that are used to manage policies within HashiCorp's Sentinel integrations. There are no user-facing changes.

## 0.15.4 (May 13, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

- `imports`: Fixed an issue with the standard imports that was affecting the handling of null data within lists. 

## 0.15.3 (April 16, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/localast`: Fixed an issue where `IndexExpr` were not rewritten, as well as ensuring `SelectorExpr` uses any nested rewrites. 
- `lang/printer`: Fixed issue printing deeply nested structures and/or loops. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `imports/decimal`: Added alias methods to improve consistency of method names within the `decimal` import. The alias methods are `is_nan` for `isnan`, as well as both `is_inf` and `is_infinite` for `isinfinite`. 
- `command/apply`: `sentinel apply` will now output the policy description when a trace is forced via `-trace`. 
- `sentinel`: Improved `String` output formatting of Policy docstring for `EvalPolicyResult`. 

## 0.15.2 (April 2, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/printer`: Fixed an issue with the `printer` that was causing a panic
  when a `#` line comment was used with no text following it. 
- `imports/types`: Fixed an issue with the `types` import where calls to
  `type_of` for undefined types were incorrectly returning as map types. These
  will now be correctly be identified as undefined as expected. 

## 0.15.1 (March 6, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

- `sentinel`: Fixed how modules are managed internally in the runtime to correct
  race conditions in concurrent scenarios and to allow for per-evaluation module
  restrictions. This functionality is only of interest to embedded applications
  with long-lived runtimes and is currently not implemented in any HashiCorp
  integration. 

## 0.15.0 (March 5, 2020)

NOTES:

- **Windows Digital Signature**. Our windows releases for this version and up will be signed
  and verified according to Microsoft's requirements.

FEATURES:

- `cmd/config`: Modules can now be loaded off of local disk using the Sentinel
  CLI. For information on how to do so, see the Sentinel documentation. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `runtime/eval`: Changed modules so that they now have singleton scope when
  loaded. Importing a module under two different aliases, or within a nested
  module, will now share scopes - modification of state in one will alter the
  other. 
- `lang/object`: Introduced an interface to allow the duplication of various
  types, like collections. 
- `runtime/eval`: Changed how collection data is returned from modules. This
  data is now duplicated to prevent accidental or deliberate circumvention of
  the prohibition on assignment to import data, and brings behavior to parity
  with binary imports. 

## 0.14.4 (February 6, 2020)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `imports/time`: Changed the `add` timespace function in the `time` import to
  allow it to take float types as durations. These values will be truncated to
  the appropriate integer-value duration. 

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/parser`: Fixed an issue where out-of-place right-hand braces were being
  parsed as empty statements, instead of raising syntax errors. 

## 0.14.3 (January 22, 2020)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `cmd/test`: Fail when an assertion is not found in a trace. 
- `cmd/test`: Added a message to notify when no rules were evaluated in a test.
  

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/printer`: Fixed an issue where import aliases (the `as baz` in `import
  "foo/bar" as baz`) were being removed when formatting with `sentinel fmt`.
  
- `imports/http`: Fixed an issue with the http import where the client library's
  debug logs were being printed to standard error. 

## 0.14.2 (January 15, 2020)

NOTES:

With this release, we are discontinuing support for MacOS 32-bit. 64-bit builds
are now the only builds available for MacOS. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `lang/printer`: A newline is now added to files formatted via `sentinel fmt`. 

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/printer`: Fixed an issue in printing where multi-line expressions would
  indent infinitely. They will now only indent once at the most. This is mostly
  seen when using `sentinel fmt`. 
- `runtime/encoding`: Fixed an issue where if a plugin returned a deeply
  embedded undefined value, the value was instead decoded into a map. 

## 0.14.1 (January 6, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/parser`: Fixed an issue where reserved words could not be used as
  selectors when the selector expression was the last lexeme on a line. 

## 0.14.0 (December 18, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **Filter Expression** `filter`. A new quantifier expression, `filter` has been added.
  `filter` returns a subset of the provided collection based on a boolean condition that
  is asserted for each element.

NOTES:

- **Apple Notarization**. Our darwin releases for this version and up will be signed
  and notarized according to Apple's requirements.

## 0.13.1 (November 25, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/eval`: Parameters are no longer allowed in mock files. Adding one to
  a mock will result in a runtime error. 
- `runtime/eval`: Fixed an issue where import calls from within mocks were
  failing under certain circumstances. 
- `imports/decimal`: `int` should now correctly provide the truncated integer
  representation of a decimal number, not the rounded one. 

## 0.13.0 (November 15, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **Policy Parameters**. The new [policy
  parameters](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/parameters) feature
  allows authors to use a `param` declaration at the top of a policy to supply
  values that are expected to come from outside of a policy. See the linked
  documentation for more details.

FEATURES:

- `imports/http`: The [`http`
  import](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/http) is a new addition
  to the standard library enabling the use of HTTP-accessible data from outside
  the runtime in policy rules.

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/eval`: Fixed an issue where loading other imports before a mocked
  import would cause those imports to no longer be visible from within the
  policy. 

## 0.12.0 (October 7, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **New `case` statement**. This statement is a selection control mechanism to
  conditionally execute a branch based on expression equality, allowing
  simplification of complex conditional chains that may otherwise need to be
  written with `else if`. See the [Case
  Statements](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/spec#case-statements)
  section of the Sentinel language specification for more details. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `lang/semantic`: Added a semantic check to ensure usage of append is not using
  a return value.  

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/eval`: Corrected an issue where calling a method on an import object
  value that was the result of a method call on another import object value
  would have erroneously tried to call an import of the name of the "parent"
  import object value. Example: in `a = subject.new(); b = a.call(); c =
  b.call()`, `b.call()` would attempt to call a method named `call` on the root
  namespace for an import named `a`. This has now been corrected so that
  `b.call()` will now correctly call the `call` method for the respective object
  namespace residing in the import named `subject`. 
- `imports`: Some standard imports may have been returning null for some unknown
  keys in objects when they should have been returning undefined. This was due
  to an SDK issue which was corrected in SDK version 0.3.2, which has now been
  corrected. 
- `cmd/test`: `sentinel test` will now correctly fail a policy if it encounters
  an error. 
- `cmd/test`: `sentinel test` will now correctly display errors and other output
  that were missing due to a formatting issue. 
- `runtime/eval`: The `append` builtin now correctly returns undefined for all
  calls, as called for by the Specification. Note that in most cases, the
  semantic check outlined above will trigger an error if the return value is
  used. 

## 0.11.0 (September 5, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **New builtin function:** `range()`. This function existed in the spec in
  earlier versions but was removed as it lacked an implementation. This has now
  been implemented and re-added to the spec. See the
  [Range](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/spec#range) section of
  the Sentinel Specification for more details. 
- Lists are now comparable. Lists are equal if their corresponding elements are
  comparable and equal. 
- Method calls on values returned by imports are now supported. See the
  [Imports](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/spec#imports) section
  of the Sentinel Specification for more details. 

FEATURES:

- `imports/decimal`: This is a new import designed to do exact precision
  mathematical calculations. 
- `runtime/eval`: Compound call expressions that refer to imports (example:
  foo.bar().baz() when `foo` is a loaded import) will now function as expected.
  Previously, this was only supported up to the first call (example:
  `foo.bar()`). 
- `imports/time`: Timespaces returned by calls such as `time.now` are now
  callable. Example: `t = time.now; t.after(some_previous_time)` will now
  function. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `runtime/eval`: The implementation of comparison of non-comparable types has
  now changed. Rather than triggering a runtime error, non-comparable types will
  now return false when attempting to compare. 

## 0.10.4 (August 15, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/encoding`: Fixed an issue with conversion of null values that could
  lead to crashes in imports. 

## 0.10.3 (July 15, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `command/config`: Parsing a configuration file where malformed data is
  encountered after apparently properly-formed data will now report an error. An
  example would be a situation where misplaced braces would cause a JSON object
  to only parse part of the configuration file. 

## 0.10.2 (June 25, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/parser`: Corrected an issue where parsing certain compound binary
  expressions where the negation predicate (`not`) was in use would cause the
  negation to have no effect. Example: `foo else "bar" not in "baz"` would have
  been parsed and evaluated as `foo else "bar" in "baz"`, effectively producing
  the opposite result. 

## 0.10.1 (May 9, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `command/test`: `sentinel test` now displays policies without
tests as an unknown result with [no test files], instead of the somewhat
erroneous behavior of displaying it as a PASS. A full test run with a mixture
of passing tests and no tests still results in an overall successful result.

## 0.10.0 (April 18, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- Mixed-number arithmetic operations are now allowed. Addition (`+`),
  subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and remainder
  operations (`%`) are no longer restricted to number values of the same
  type, and can mix integer and floating point. The result of these operations
  is always a floating-point number. 
- Remainder (modulo, `%`) operations are now allowed on floating-point numbers.
  

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/parser`: Fixed a bug that affected the use of `not` with `contains`,
  `matches`, or `in` in a compound expression. 
- `runtime/eval`: Fixed error messages on evaluation errors with `contains` and
  `in` to indicate that strings are an allowed type along with lists and maps.
  

## 0.9.2 (March 15, 2019)

This is a dependency update related to the changes mentioned in 0.9.1. No other
changes have been made.

## 0.9.1 (March 14, 2019)

This is a patch release that is required to integrate with the latest versions
of the [Sentinel SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-sdk). No other
changes have been made.

## 0.9.0 (January 28, 2019)

FEATURES:

- `imports/strings`: Added a `join` function to the `strings` import. This can
  be used to join a list into a string with a specific separator.
  Multi-dimensional lists and all Sentinel primitives are supported.

## 0.8.1 (January 17, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/eval`: Fixed a bug that prevents the effective use of `return`
  statements in `for` loops. 

## 0.8.0 (January 14, 2019)

FEATURES:

- Mocks can now be represented by Sentinel code. This allows for the mocking of
  functions and other complex data structures that cannot be represented in
  JSON. For more information on using this feature via mocks, click
  [here](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/commands/config#mocking-with-sentinel-code).
  

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Import validation has now been moved to the semantic checking phase. This
  should result in better reporting of validation errors. In addition, import
  validation will now enforce the use of an `as` identifier when an import path
  is not a valid identifier on its own (example: `import "foo/bar"`). 

## 0.7.0 (December 12, 2018)

BUG FIXES:

- There have been changes to the runtime in how scope is handled over multiple
  policy executions. Scope is now correctly unique per single policy execution,
  and values set or builtins that are overridden in one policy will no longer
  affect those values within another. 

## 0.6.0 (November 30, 2018)

FEATURES:

- `imports/runtime`: This new import allows for one to check various aspects of
  the Sentinel runtime as it may be embedded in the simulator or a specific
  implementation. For now, it allows the version to be checked. 

## 0.5.1 (November 28, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `imports/time`: Added the `zone` and `zone_string` attributes to assist with
  validation of a timespace's zone. 
- `command/fmt`: Added a new -check flag. This option does not commit changes,
  but instead checks to see what files need formatting and outputs them on
  stdout. 

BUG FIXES:

- `command/test`: Ensure that passing test results are correctly output one per
  line. Tests are also now run in a deterministic fashion based on
  lexicographical (alphabetical) order. 
- `imports/time`: `month_name` and `weekday_name` will now show up correctly in
  a returned timespace result. 


## 0.5.0 (November 5, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `spec`: Selectors can now contain any reserved word (example: `rule`) or
  keyword operator (example: `any`, `all`, `is`, `not`). This only works for the
  _selector_ part of the expression (after the first period) - the first primary
  expression (before the first period) still needs to be an identifier that does
  not conflict with reserved words. 

BUG FIXES:

- The simulator should now display import function call names correctly in
  import errors. 

## 0.4.0 (October 1, 2018)

FEATURES:

- `builtin`: Added the `bool` built-in type conversion function. Booleans will
  also now accepted as conversion into other values as well, with the full list
  of behaviors available in the spec. 

## 0.3.2 (September 27, 2018)

FEATURES:

- `command/apply`: `sentinel apply` now prints out messages output by the
  `print()` function when a trace is output on policy failure, or when a trace
  is forced with `-trace`. 
- `imports/time`: Added the `month_name` and `weekday_name` keys to the
  timespace, which return full-English names for the month and day of the week.
  

BUG FIXES:

- `command/fmt`: `sentinel fmt -` Will no longer print out the filter status
  message on the output stream when `-write=false` Is not explicitly stated.
  This brings the behavior of the command in line with the help text. 
- `runtime`: Index operations on the right-hand-side that have negative indexes
  that go out of range (example: `length(list) * -1 - 1`) now correctly return
  `undefined`. left-hand-side index assignments with a out-of-range negative
  index still return runtime errors. 

## 0.3.1 (August 3, 2018)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime`: Basic index assignment has been implemented as per the spec. 
- `runtime`: Index expressions for lists with negative indexes will no longer panic if the
  list index is less than `length(list) * -1`. 

## 0.3.0 (July 20, 2018)

FEATURES:

- **New standard import: `types`.** This can be used to dynamicaly detect the
  type of some value. 

## 0.2.0 (April 11, 2018)

FEATURES:

- **New standard import: `json`.** Marshal and unmarshal JSON documents and
  access their contents as native Sentinel values. 
- **`break` and `continue`.** These are now both specified and implemented.
  `break` allows loop exiting and `continue` allows immediate execution of the
  next iteration. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

- runtime: `print()` map values are now ordered alphabetically by keys. 

BUG FIXES:

- command/test: If no `test` block exists, test behaves like it is asserting
  `main: true`. 
- runtime: default maximum stack depth to 500
- runtime: `print()` map values now appear like more typical maps. 
- runtime: division by zero is an error, not a crash 
- runtime: plugins that send map values with `null` values now decode properly
  into native Sentinel values. 

## 0.1.0 (September 19, 2017)

Initial release.
