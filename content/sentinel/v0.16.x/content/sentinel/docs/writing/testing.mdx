# Testing

Sentinel has a built-in test framework to validate a policy behaves as expected.

With an ever-increasing amount of automation surrounding technology,
the guardrails provided by policies are a critical piece towards ensuring
expected behavior. As a reliance on correct policy increases, it is important
to test and verify policies.

Testing is a necessary step to fully realize
[policy as code](/sentinel/concepts/policy-as-code). Just as good software
is well tested, a good set of policies should be equally well tested.

## Test Folder Structure

Policies are tested by asserting that [rules](/sentinel/writing/rules)
are the expected values given a pre-configured input. Tests are run
by executing the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test).

Sentinel is opinionated about the folder structure required for tests.
This opinionated structure allows testing to be as simple as running
`sentinel test` with no arguments. Additionally, it becomes simple to test
in a CI or add new policies.

The structure Sentinel expects is `test/<policy>/*.json` where `<policy>`
is the name of your policy file without the file extension. Within
that folder is a list of JSON files. Each JSON file represents a single
test case. Therefore, each policy can have multiple tests associated with
it.

## Test Case Format

Each JSON file within the test folder for a policy is a single test case.

The JSON file is the same configuration format as the [CLI configuration
file](/sentinel/configuration). The format lets you define mock data, imports
to use, and more. This mock data is the key piece in being able to test
policies: you craft a specific scenario and assert your policy behaves as you
expect.

Test cases also use the special key `test` within the configuration file
to assert the boolean value of [rules](/sentinel/writing/rules). If
the `test` key is omitted, the policy is expected to pass (the same
as asserting that the `main` rule is true). If the test key is specified,
only the rules specified in the map will be asserted. This means if you
omit `main`, then the final policy result is not asserted.

Example with assertions:

```json
{
  "param": {
    "day": "monday",
    "hour": 7
  },

  "test": {
    "main": false,
    "is_open_hours": false,
    "is_weekday": true
  }
}
```

The configuration above specifies some parameter data, and asserts the result of
some rules. This is the same configuration used in the example section below.

## Example

Lets use the following file as an example. Save this file to a directory
and name it `policy.sentinel`. It can be named anything with the `sentinel`
extension, but by naming it `policy.sentinel` your output should match
the example output on this page.

```sentinel
// The day of the week.
param day

// The hour of the day.
param hour

is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

### A Passing Test

Next, let's define a single test case. Relative to where you saved
the policy, create a file at the path `test/policy/good.json`.

```json
{
  "param": {
    "day": "monday",
    "hour": 14
  }
}
```

Now run `sentinel test`:

```
$ sentinel test
PASS - policy.sentinel
  PASS - test/policy/good.json
```

This passed because the policy passed. We didn't assert any specific
rules. By not specifying any assertions, `test` expects the policy itself
to fully pass.

### A Failing Test

Define another test case to fail. We want to verify our policy fails when expected, too.

Save the following as `test/policy/7-am.json`:

```json
{
  "param": {
    "day": "monday",
    "hour": 7
  }
}
```

Now run `sentinel test`:

```
$ sentinel test
FAIL - policy.sentinel
  FAIL - test/policy/7-am.json
    expected "main" to be true, got: false

    trace:
      FALSE - policy.sentinel:9:1 - Rule "main"
        FALSE - policy.sentinel:9:15 - is_open_hours
          FALSE - policy.sentinel:8:24 - hour > 8 and hour < 17
            FALSE - policy.sentinel:8:24 - hour > 8

      FALSE - policy.sentinel:8:1 - Rule "is_open_hours"
        FALSE - policy.sentinel:8:24 - hour > 8
  PASS - test/policy/good.json
```

As you can see, the test fails because "main" is false. This is good
because the policy _should_ have failed since we specified an invalid
hour. But, we expect main to be false and don't want our test to fail!
Update `7-am.json` to add test assertions:

```json
{
  "param": {
    "day": "monday",
    "hour": 7
  },

  "test": {
    "main": false,
    "is_open_hours": false,
    "is_weekday": true
  }
}
```

And when we run the tests:

```
$ sentinel test
PASS - policy.sentinel
  PASS - test/policy/7-am.json
  PASS - test/policy/good.json
```

The test passes. We asserted that we expect the `main` rule to be false,
the `is_open_hours` rule to be false, and the `is_weekday` rule to be
true. By asserting some rules are true, we can verify that our policy
is failing for reasons we expect.

## Mocking

The above example demonstrates how to test by supplying different
[parameters](/sentinel/language/parameters). Parameters in a policy can be
specifically useful when you want to control user-defined input values to a
policy.

However, generally, when testing, you will need mimic the conditions you will
see in production. Production implementations of Sentinel will supply data using
one of two methods:

- **Global data:** Data is injected directly into the policy's scope and is
  accessible using normal identifiers, similar to variables.
- **Imports:** Data is stored behind an [import](/sentinel/language/imports)
  and loaded on demand as needed by the policy author.

Proper testing of a policy requires that these values be able to be _mocked_ -
or, in other words, simulated in a way that allows the accurate testing of the
scenarios that a policy could reasonably pass or fail under.

Mocking both globals and imports can be done by setting various parts of the
configuration file.

### Mocking Globals

Demonstrating the mocking of globals can be seen by making a few modifications to
our example policy, removing the `param` declarations:

```sentinel
is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

Then, change the `param` section in the configuration file to
[`global`](/sentinel/configuration#global).

```json
{
  "global": {
    "day": "monday",
    "hour": 14
  }
}
```

This test should still pass, as if nothing had happened, although what we've
done is shifted our parameters to globals, simulating an environment where `day`
and `hour` are already defined for us.

### Mocking Imports

To mock imports, we need to use the
[`mock`](/sentinel/configuration#mock-imports) section of the
configuration file.

Let's say the above example is behind an import named `time`.

-> **NOTE:** [`time`](/sentinel/imports/time) is a valid standard import.
This example may not be accurate to the
import's syntax.

The code now looks like this:

```sentinel
import "time"

is_weekday = rule { time.now.weekday_name not in ["Saturday", "Sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { time.now.hour > 8 and time.now.hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

To mock this import, we can [mock it as static
data](/sentinel/configuration#mocking-static-data). The configuration
file now looks like, without assertions:

```json
{
  "mock": {
    "time": {
      "now": {
        "weekday_name": "Monday",
        "hour": 14
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The policy will now pass, with the `time` import mocked.

Data can also be [mocked as Sentinel
code](/sentinel/configuration#mocking-with-sentinel-code). In this case,
the above configuration file would look like:

```json
{
  "mock": {
    "time": "mock-time.sentinel"
  }
}
```

And a file named `mock-time.sentinel` would now hold your mock values:

```sentinel
day = "monday"
hour = 14
```

Mocking as Sentinel code allows more complex details to be mocked as well, such
as functions. Say we wanted to mock the `time.load()` function. To mock this,
just add it to the `mock-time.sentinel` file:

```sentinel
load = func(_) {
	return {
		"weekday_name":  "Monday",
		"hour": 14,
	}
}
```

Your code can now be written as:

```sentinel
import "time"

t = time.load("a_mock_timestamp")

is_weekday = rule { t.weekday_name not in ["Saturday", "Sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { t.hour > 8 and t.hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

To see more details, see the [Mock
Imports](/sentinel/configuration#mock-imports) section in the
configuration file.

## Test Automation

The `sentinel test` command was designed to be automation friendly.
We encourage you to enable a CI such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)
on your policy repositories to continuously run tests. An example
`.travis.yml` configuration file is shown below:

```yaml
language: bash
script: sentinel test
```
