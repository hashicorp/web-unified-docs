# Command: `test`

The `sentinel test` command runs policies against the Sentinel test framework.

To learn more about testing, see the [testing
policies](/sentinel/writing/testing) page.

## Usage

Usage: `sentinel test [options] [PATH] ...`

This command runs the defined test cases against a set of policies.

The test cases are expected to live at the path `test/<policy>/*.[hcl|json]` relative
to the policy being tested. `<policy>` should be the name of the policy
excluding the file extension. The files should be in the [configuration
file structure](/sentinel/configuration). The `test` key is used for
assertions.

The PATH arguments specified may be a list of zero or more files or directories.
When no arguments are given, it defaults to the current directory. When a
directory is given, all policies ending with the extension `.sentinel` are
tested.

The command-line flags are all optional. The list of available flags are:

- `-color` - Enable or disable colorized output. Enabled by default if
  running interactively.

- `-run=regexp` - Run only tests matching the regular expression pattern.
  A `/` splits policy name and test case name.

- `-verbose` - Show tracing and log output for tests that succeed in addition
  to tests that fail. By default, traces and logs are only shown for tests that
  fail.
