# Extending Sentinel

-> **NOTE:** Sentinel's extensibility is currently undergoing large
improvements - watch this space for future updates!

Sentinel can be extended by writing additional
[imports](/sentinel/language/imports). These imports can bring new functionality
to Sentinel by allowing access to new data or by the addition of new functions.
This section is designed to show you how to accomplish this extensibility and
describe how it works.

Currently, the only usable way to add additional imports is via
[modules](#modules). While [plugins](#plugins) currently work under the Sentinel
CLI, no Sentinel integration currently supports their use.

-> You may also be interested in advanced details on [import
internals](/sentinel/extending/internals).

## Modules

Modules allow you to re-use Sentinel code as an import. Modules are loaded
external of policies and mapped to imports. This is usually configured via a
file such as the [CLI configuration file](/sentinel/commands/config).

See the [modules](/sentinel/extending/modules) section for more details.

## Plugins

-> **NOTE:** plugins are currently only supported on the CLI and not in any
production Sentinel integration.

Imports can also be implemented as plugins when Sentinel code itself is too
restrictive to represent the import, or if you need access to features not
normally available to the Sentinel runtime.

See the [plugins](/sentinel/extending/plugins) section for more details.
