# Imports

Imports enable a Sentinel policy to access reusable libraries and external data
and functions. Anyone can write their own [custom import](/sentinel/extending).
Imports are what enable Sentinel policies to do more than look at only local
context for making policy decisions.

Sentinel also comes with a set of [standard imports](/sentinel/imports).
Standard imports are available to every Sentinel policy to help policy writers
with common tasks such as working with the time, network addresses, and more.

-> **This page is about writing policies that _use_ imports.** If you're
interested in _creating_ a new import, please see the section on [extending
Sentinel](/sentinel/extending) for information on how to write modules and
import plugins.

## Using Imports

To use an import, you use the `import` keyword at the top of your policy. This
specifies the name of the import you want to use. The application you're writing
the policy for must already be
[configured](/sentinel/extending/plugins#installing-plugins) to provide that
import.

Details on imports can be found in the
[import section in the language reference](/sentinel/language/imports).

In the example below, we use the [time](/sentinel/imports/time) import:

```sentinel
import "time"

is_weekday = rule { time.now.weekday_name not in ["Saturday", "Sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { time.now.hour > 8 and time.now.hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

There are two options to develop a policy locally when using imports:
configure Sentinel to launch the import on `apply`, or mock the import
using `mock`. The former requires access to the import plugin while the
latter is faster (doesn't have to launch a process) and doesn't require
the plugin.

## Mocking Imports

The first option to developing policies locally is to mock the import values.
When mocking an import, you don't need the import plugin available. This can be
useful since some imports may not be available as a plugin and may only be
available to the application the policy runs in.

Mocks are specified via the [configuration
file](/sentinel/commands/config). Mocks can also be used for
[testing](/sentinel/writing/testing).

You can supply mock configuration one of two ways, depending on your use case:

- **[Using static data](/sentinel/commands/config#mocking-static-data):**
  Use this method when you can accurately represent your mock data in JSON and
  do not need to mock complex Sentinel features such as functions.
- **[Using Sentinel code](/sentinel/commands/config#mocking-with-sentinel-code):**
  Use this method when using a static JSON object is insufficient, such as when
  you need to mock functions or other complex Sentinel features.

Our example does not require complex data to be mocked, so a static JSON object
is sufficient:

```json
{
  "mock": {
    "time": {
      "now": {
        "hour": 12,
        "weekday_name": "Tuesday"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This can be used via the CLI:

```
$ sentinel apply -config=config.json policy.sentinel
Pass
```

## Launching Imports

If you have access to the plugin binary, you can launch the import. The
benefit of this is that it is really using the import to test your
policy. If the import changes, your policies may start failing. If you
only use mock data and the import changes, your policies will still
appear to work.

Imports are configured in the configuration file:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "time": {
      "path": "/path/to/sentinel-time-import"
    }
  }
}
```

This would require the `sentinel-time-import` binary. For this example
this doesn't currently exist. We plan on writing one to provide for this
section of the documentation.

## Custom Imports

You can also [create your own imports](/sentinel/extending).

If your policy decisions could benefit from accessing external information,
then you can use custom imports as a way to do this.
