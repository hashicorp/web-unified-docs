# Imports

Imports enable a Sentinel policy to access reusable libraries and external data
and functions. Anyone can write their own [custom import](/sentinel/extending).
Imports are what enable Sentinel policies to do more than look at only
local context for making policy decisions.

Imports are extremely powerful. They enable policy decision based on arbitrary
external information. For example, a behavior coming into a system can be
allowed or denied based on information from a separate system where the two
systems can be unaware of each other.

The example below shows a concrete example. For the example, imagine that the
import calendar allows access to engineer calendars. This import only exists
for the purpose of this example and at the time of writing is not a real
available import.

```json sentinel
{
  "policy": "import \"calendar\"\n// Get the calendar for Bob for today\nbob_calendar = calendar.of(\"bob\").today\n\n// Allow this policy to pass if Bob is not on vacation.\nmain = rule { not bob_calendar.has_event(\"vacation\") }",
  "mocks": {
    "calendar": "has_event = func(event) {\n\treturn true\n}\nof = func(name) {\n\treturn { \"today\": { \"has_event\": has_event } }\n}"
  }
}
```
