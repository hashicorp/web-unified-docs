# Language: Scope

Scope is the context in which variables are created and accessed. If a
variable exists in a parent scope, it is accessed and can be modified.
Otherwise, the variable is created in your current scope.

Scopes are created with _blocks_. A block is a possibly empty sequence
of statements within matching brace brackets `{}`. You may nest blocks
to create nested scopes.

In addition to explicitly created blocks, there are implicit blocks:

1. The policy block encapsulates an entire policy.
2. Each `any`, `all`, and `for` statement is considered to be in
   its own block. Note that `if` statements _do not_ create their
   own block.

The example policy below shows various effects of scopes:

```sentinel
a = 1
print(a) // 1

f = func() {
	print(a) // 1
	a = 12
	b = 1
	return undefined
}
f()

print(a) // 12
print(b) // undefined
```
