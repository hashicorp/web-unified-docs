# Language: Logging and Errors

The built-in functions `print` and `error` can be used for logging
and errors. Logging is helpful to understand how a policy is executing
in development. And errors are useful to halting execution immediately in
certain scenarios.

## Print

The `print` function is used to output debug information. The exact location
where this print statements go is dependent on the host application and
the Sentinel runtime itself.

The `print` function takes one or more Sentinel values as arguments.
Each value is formatted for human-friendly output and space-separated.
Example:

```sentinel
value = 42
print("the value is", value) // the value is 42

map = { "foo": false }
print(map) // { "foo": false }

one_is_zero = rule { 1 == 0 }
print(one_is_zero) // false
```

## Errors

Certain actions in Sentinel, such as accessing an undefined variable,
attempting to add two incompatible types, etc. result in _runtime errors_.
These errors halt the execution of a policy immediately. The pass/fail result
of a policy is considered fail.

Runtime errors can be manually triggered using the `error` function.
The `error` function behaves exactly like the `print` function except that
execution is halted immediately.

This should only be used in scenarios where the policy _must fail_ due to
some unexpected or invalid condition. The line between `error` and
[undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined) can sometimes be unclear. Undefined
is recommended when a policy can conceivably recover or safely ignore the
undefined behavior. An error should be used when the policy should fail and
notify someone regardless.
