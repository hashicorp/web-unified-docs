# Builtin Function: append

The built-in function `append` appends a value to the end of a list. The list
is modified in-place. The return value will always be [undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined).

`append` called on any value other than a list or undefined will result
in an immediate error.

Examples:

```sentinel
append([1,2], 3)      // [1, 2, 3]
append(1, 3)          // error()
append(undefined, 3)  // error()
append([], undefined) // [undefined] (a list containing `undefined`)
```

### Why does this function return undefined?

This function returns `undefined` to avoid unintended side effects of the function in the context
of a [rule](/sentinel/language/rules).

For example, if `append` returned the list value as a result, the following policy would depend
on the order in which rules are referenced:

```sentinel
list = []
a = rule { append(list, 1) contains 1 }
b = rule { append(list, 2) contains 2 }

// Scenario 1: list becomes [1, 2]
main = rule { a and b }

// Scenario 2: list becomes [2, 1]
main = rule { b and a }
```

This sort of side effect behavior introduces complex and difficult to track logical errors in programs.
As a result, functions like this return `undefined` and modify values in-place.
