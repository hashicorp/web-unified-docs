# Terraform

[HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/) use Sentinel to enforce
policy on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) configurations, states, and plans.

The Sentinel integration with Terraform runs within
HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise
after a `terraform plan` and before a `terraform apply`. The policies
have access to the created plan, the state at the time of the plan,
and the configuration at the time of the plan.

The Terraform integration with Sentinel is documented in depth in the [HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/sentinel).
Please read that page for full documentation. This page will only show basic examples.

### Examples

**Example: All AWS instances must have a tag**

```sentinel
import "tfplan"

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resources.aws*instance as *, instances {
    all instances as \_, r {
      (length(r.applied.tags) else 0) > 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: Only allow GCP instance sizes smaller than `n1-standard-16`**

```sentinel
import "tfplan"

allowed_machine_types = [
  "n1-standard-1",
  "n1-standard-2",
  "n1-standard-4",
  "n1-standard-8",
]

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resources.google_compute_instance as _, instances {
    all instances as _, r {
      r.applied.machine_type in allowed_machine_types
    }
  }
}
```
