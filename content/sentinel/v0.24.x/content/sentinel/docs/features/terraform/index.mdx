# terraform feature

The `terraform` feature enhances the Sentinel runtime to work with Terraform
data. It will add the following imports to the standard library:

- [tfplan/v1](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfplan-v1)
- [tfplan/v2](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfplan-v2)
- [tfconfig/v1](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfconfig-v1)
- [tfconfig/v2](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfconfig-v2)
- [tfstate/v1](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfstate-v1)
- [tfstate/v2](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfstate-v2)

-> **NOTE:** The above imports will only work with Terraform 0.12 and above,
as they rely on the output from the `terraform show -json` command.

It is recommended that the `/v2` suffixed imports are used, as they provide
the best experience when interacting with the underlying data structures.
