# Logic

The core of a policy is a set of logical expressions to determine whether
a behavior is allowed or not.
Sentinel makes it easy to write readable logical expressions to express
the intended policy.

The logical expression syntax will be familiar to anyone who has programmed
before. Sentinel also supports a couple more unique constructs to assist
with common policy requirements. Detailed documentation on how to write
logical expressions and the supported operators is available in
[the boolean expression reference](/sentinel/language/boolexpr).

Example logic:

```sentinel
a is b        // Equality, you can also use ==
a is not b    // Inequality, you can also use !=

a > b         // Relational operators, comparison
a < b
a >= b
a <= b

a contains b     // Inclusion check, substrings, etc.
a not contains b // Negated version of above
```

The full list of available operators can be found in
[the boolean expression reference](/sentinel/language/boolexpr).

Logic can be combined with `and` or `or`. When combined with `and`, both
sides must result in `true`. When combined with `or`, only one side needs
to be true to result in `true`.

With these building blocks, basic rules can be built up:

```sentinel
main = rule {
	hour >= 8 and
	hour < 17
}
```

Next, we'll introduce
[imports](/sentinel/intro/getting-started/imports)
so that we can write rules that interact with external data.
