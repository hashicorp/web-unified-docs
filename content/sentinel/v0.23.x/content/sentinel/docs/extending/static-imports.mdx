# Extending Sentinel: Static Imports

Static imports allow you to write imports that use static data files. This can
provide methods of consuming data in ways that are not available via
[modules](./modules) or [plugins](./plugins).

### Configuring a Static Import

The [configuration page](/sentinel/configuration#static-imports) details how to
configure static imports.

### Usage

Using a static import is not that different to using a plugin or module. The
import must first be introduced to the policy via an import statement.

```sentinel
import "people"
```

From here, the static data can be used throughout the policy as you would any
normal Sentinel value.

```sentinel
admins = filter people as person {
  person.role is "Admin"
}
```

One differentiator for static imports is that you can directly reference the
import without the use of selectors. For example, to print the value;

```sentinel
print(people)
```

This is due to the static data being directly loaded and converted into a
Sentinel value, ready for use. Static imports, like modules and plugins, cannot
be assigned a new value.
