1. Click on your peering connection, scroll down to the Peering Instructions area, then click the **Azure Cloud Shell** tab.

1. Log into your Azure account.

   ```shell-session
   $ az login
   ```

1. Create a [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps).

1. Create a [custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/custom-create#create-a-role-using-powershell) with the following attributes:

   - Scope: Your VNet ID
   - Permissions:
      - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/peer/action`
      - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/read`
      - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/write`

1. Create a [role assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps) between the custom role and the service principal.

   <Tip title="Background information">

   You need to create an Azure service principal in the context of a
   subscription and a custom Azure role with restricted permissions to accept
   the peering. Then, associate the service principal with that custom role.
   This service principal is used to establish the peering from Azure to HCP.
   This use of a service principal with custom permissions provides a more
   secure or conservative approach to completing the peering process.

   </Tip>

1. Go to the [Azure Virtual Network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FvirtualNetworks) page in the web console, and select your respective Virtual Network.

1. Click on the **Peering** option that is on the left sidebar. You should now have an entry in the **Peering Status** column with a status of **Connected**.

   <Note>

   It may take a few minutes before the peering connection is available and visible.
