To start the peering procedure that allows for communication between HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) and Microsoft Azure, you will initiate the peering connection from [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. In your HCP web console, navigate to the left sidebar and click on the **HashiCorp Virtual Network** tab.

1. Select the HVN you want to create a peering connection with.

1. In the selected HVN overview page, navigate to the left sidebar and click on the **Peering connections** link.

1. Click on **Create connection** to create a peering relationship with your Azure virtual network.

1. Fill in the requested information and click the **Create connection** button to begin the peering process.

   <Note>

   If you are unsure of where to find the required resource IDs, click on the link labeled **Where can I find this?**. The link provides helpful information and a screenshot of where in the Azure web console this information can be found.

   </Note>

1. Once the connection has been created, the **Peering connections** page will show a Pending state for your peering connection (similar to the example screenshot below) until it is accepted in Azure.
