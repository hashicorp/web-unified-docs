The AppRole authentication method is ideal for systems that don't run in Kubernetes, allowing flexible programmatic access.

Follow the AppRole Auth Method process for a Vault cluster [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle). After setup, you will have an AppRole role ID and secret ID created in Vault.

1. Create an AppRole, replace `<role_name>` with your setup details.

   ```shell-session
   vault write auth/approle/role/<role_name> policies=<vault_policy>
   ```

1. Retrieve the role ID and secret ID.

   ```shell-session
   vault read auth/approle/role/<role_name>/role-id
   vault write -f auth/approle/role/<role_name>/secret-id
   ```

1. Save the role ID and secret ID as environment variables for the agent.

   ```shell-session
   export VAULT_ROLE_ID=<role_id>
   export VAULT_SECRET_ID=<secret_id>
   ```

1. From the UI, select the **App Role** authentication method and enter the authentication path and the role ID and secret ID environment variables.
