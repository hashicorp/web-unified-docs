The token-based method uses Vault's generated tokens for authentication. This method is more straightforward and easy to use.

1. Generate a valid Vault token by following the steps
   [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token).

1. Set the token as an environment variable for the agent.
   
   ```shell-session
   $export VAULT_TOKEN=<vault_token>
   ```

1. From the UI, select **Token** for the **Authentication method** and then enter
   the environment variable just configured. (ex. `env://VAULT_TOKEN`).
