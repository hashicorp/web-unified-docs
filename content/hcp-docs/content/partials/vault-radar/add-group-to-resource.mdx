Once you add a data source, an HCP user with the `admin` role must assign
a group to each of the monitored resources within each data source. You can
assign each resource to only one group.

<Note>

Users with the HCP IAM admin role do not need to be a member of other groups. Accounts
with the admin role have full access to Vault Radar.

</Note>

1. Create a group at the HCP project level.

1. Assign either the viewer or contributor role to the group.

1. Navigate to the resource and click **Add to group**.

1. Select the group that requires access to the resource.
