Using the Agent requires that you create your own GitHub App.

1. Create an app [following the instructions
   here](https://github.com/hashicorp-guides/vault-radar-demo/tree/main/github-app).
   Note: a step in those instructions is to add the app configuration details in the Vault Radar UI.

2. Install the app created from step 1 on the organization (You must have permissions in GitHub to install the app).
