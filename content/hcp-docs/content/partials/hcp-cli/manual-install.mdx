You can download a [precompiled binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/hcp/) and
run it on your machine locally. You can also verify the binary using the
available SHA-256 sums. After downloading `hcp`, unzip the package. Make sure
that the `hcp` binary is available on your `PATH` before continuing with the
other guides.
