### Verify domain

You need a DNS record (secret value to set as TXT) to prove ownership of a domain. HCP uses the domain to match the email addresses for SSO. You must use different SSO domains for each HCP organization. If you try to reuse a domain name, the DNS connection request will fail.

To verify your domain:

1. Copy the verification TXT record from the HCP SSO configuration to the DNS records of any email domains your organization uses.
1. Return to the HCP **Settings** page and add your email address domains.
1. Click **Verify domains**.

If the verification is successful, you can continue configuring SSO. If the request fails, your changes to the DNS records may not have propagated yet. It can take up to 72 hours.
