HCP uses a role-based access controls (RBAC) system to enable members of your organizations and projects to perform actions in HCP and interact with resources. Some HCP applications allow you to assign roles for specific resources, such as an HCP Packer bucket. Refer to the specific HCP application documentation for more information.

### Types of Roles

HCP has general grouping of roles on the platform: Basic (All services)  roles and fine grained (service) roles. 

*Basic (All services) roles* contain permissions from all/most services. Consider using basic roles initially when setting up and adopting HCP. However, they should be replaced with fine-grained roles when adding production workloads. 

*Fine grained (service) roles* contain permissions from one or a minimal set of services. They are the preferred method for access management and should be leveraged over basic (All services) roles when applicable.  


### Inheritance
Each resource in a HCP organization has an IAM policy associated with it that informs about the level of access allowed on that resource. This IAM policy is a data structure that provides a mapping of roles to principals assigned to that resource.

Users inherit role permissions according to the following hierarchy:

1. Role assigned in the organization.
1. Role assigned in the project.
1. Role assigned for the resource.

Permissions are inherited through the resource hierarchy. And they are effective for the resource they are assigned to and all of that resource's descendants.

For example, a user assigned the `viewer` role in an organization also has `viewer` role permissions for projects within the organization. Moreover, a user assigned the `contributor` role in a project also has `contributor` role permissions for resources within the project.

If a user has an `viewer` role in an organization and `admin` role on a project in the same organization, the user receives a concatenation of `viewer` _and_ `admin` role permissions within that specific project.
