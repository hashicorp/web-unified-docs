HCP uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to enable members of your organizations and projects to perform actions in HCP and interact with resources. Some HCP applications allow you to assign roles for specific resources, such as an HCP Packer bucket. Refer to the individual HCP service's documentation for more information.

### Types of Roles

You can configure HCP roles for an organization at two levels:

- _Basic roles_ control permissions from all services in an organization. Basic roles are useful when you initially set up and adopt HCP, but you should replace them with fine-grained roles when adding production workloads.
- _Fine-grained roles_ control permissions for one or more services. We recommend using fine-grained roles for access management when using HCP to manage production workloads and interact with production networks.

### Inheritance

Each resource in an HCP organization has an IAM policy associated with it that sets the level of access allowed on that resource. This IAM policy is a data structure that provides a mapping of roles to principals assigned to that resource.

![Role Permission Inheritance](/img/docs/hcp-core/diagram-hcp_IAM-inheritance.png)

Users inherit role permissions according to the following hierarchy:

1. Role assigned in the organization.
1. Role assigned in the project.
1. Role assigned for the resource.

Permissions are inherited through the resource hierarchy. And they are effective for the resource they are assigned to and all of that resource's descendants.

For example, a user assigned the `viewer` role in an organization also has `viewer` role permissions for projects within the organization. Similarly, a user assigned the `contributor` role in a project also has `contributor` role permissions for resources within the project.

If a user has a `viewer` role in an organization and an `admin` role on a project in the same organization, the user receives a concatenation of `viewer` _and_ `admin` role permissions within that specific project.
