# What is HCP Vagrant Registry?

HCP Vagrant Registry, also referred to as HCP Vagrant, is a public, searchable index of Vagrant boxes that lets box owners publish and share their Vagrant boxes.

Boxes are the package format for HashiCorp Vagrant environments. You can use a box to bring up an identical working environment on any Vagrant-supported platform. Refer to the [Vagrant boxes](/vagrant/docs/boxes) documentation for more information.
 
## How does HCP Vagrant work?

HCP Vagrant stores and serves metadata associated with Vagrant Boxes in the form of Vagrant [`.box`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/boxes/format) files which contain all the required information for a provider to launch a Vagrant machine.

The two primary workflows for HCP Vagrant are [box discovery](#box-discovery) and [box creation & versioning](#box-creation-and-versioning).

### Box discovery

The **Discover Public Boxes** page lets you find and filter publicly available Vagrant boxes by supported providers and architectures. These are boxes created by both HashiCorp and community contributions. You can find an owner of a box by selecting their username in the URL or clicking on their username in the top left corner of the box page.

Public Vagrant boxes are a popular way to set a base development environment launchable in a single command within an organization or community.

### Box creation and versioning

HCP Vagrant lets members of your HCP organization create new versions of boxes in your registry. Versioning boxes in HCP Vagrant lets you update their content, implement fixes, and communicate the changes you make. 

## HCP Vagrant and Vagrant Cloud

In December 2022, Vagrant Cloud integrated with HCP Vagrant, delegating new user creation and account management to HCP at that time.  

Vagrant Cloud users have the opportunity to migrate their Vagrant Cloud organizations to HCP Vagrant in advance of the site-wide migration of Vagrant Cloud to HCP Vagrant. Refer to the [migrate to HCP Vagrant Registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/vagrant-cloud/hcp-vagrant/migration-guide) documentation for more information. 

The Vagrant team has started to migrate all existing boxes to HCP Vagrant and retire Vagrant Cloud. If you have not migrated your boxes, we will contact you at the email address associated with your primary Vagrant Cloud organization with instructions on how to claim your boxes in HCP Vagrant. 

Migrated organizations will be permanently accessible at their original Vagrant Cloud URLs and won’t require changes to user workflows. Migrated registries will have access to the modern HCP Vagrant UI, an improved search experience, and free private boxes.

## Changes from Vagrant Cloud

HCP Vagrant inherits HCP’s resource sharing and access control model and does not support Vagrant Cloud Collaborators.

An HCP Vagrant registry, and any private boxes within that registry, are visible to any HCP user with access to the parent HCP organization.

Since HCP Vagrant does not currently support box or registry level access restrictions, paid Vagrant Cloud users who migrate to HCP Vagrant will no longer be charged for their private boxes.
