# Reclaim registries from Vagrant Cloud

This topic explains how to reclaim your Vagrant Cloud registries in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vagrant Registry that we're migrated by HashiCorp. 

HCP Vagrant launched in early spring 2024 as the successor to Vagrant Cloud. As the next step of the transition, HashiCorp is automatically migrating existing Vagrant Cloud boxes to HCP Vagrant. While auto-migrated boxes remain available at their current URLs, organization owners must claim their registries to continue managing and releasing boxes.

## Reclamation process overview

The migration process follows these major steps:

1. Organization owners receive a notification email after HashiCorp migrates their organization.
1. Users sign into HCP and view their unclaimed registries.
1. Users claim their registries by selecting them and assigning them to an HCP project.
1. After claiming registries, users can manage them through the HCP UI.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration process, you will need an HCP account that uses the same email associated with your Vagrant Cloud account. The email associated with your Vagrant Cloud account may be different from your Vagrant Cloud login email. You can visit `Profile` in the Vagrant Cloud settings to verify your primary email address.

## Check migration status

When HashiCorp migrates their Vagrant Cloud organization, all users with owner level access will receive a notification on how to reclaim your auto migrated registry. If you have not received a notification, check your spam folder for the email.

Migrated organizations are not available from **Settings** in Vagrant Cloud. If an organization is no longer visible in Vagrant Cloud settings, HashiCorp has likely auto-migrated the organization to HCP Vagrant Registry.

## Access your unclaimed registries

You need to link your Vagrant Cloud and HCP Vagrant accounts before you can view and reclaim your Vagrant Cloud registries. If you have not linked your Vagrant Cloud account, click **Link & reclaim** and sign into Vagrant Cloud to link your accounts.

Navigate to **Vagrant Registry**, then **Unclaimed Registries** in the sidebar to view the auto migrated Vagrant Cloud organizations associated with your account.

## Claim your registries

After you link Vagrant Cloud and HCP accounts, the **Unclaimed Registries** page will have a list of auto migrated registries. This process will only take a few moments but some users may need to refresh the **Unclaimed Registries** page.

Select the checkboxes for registries you want to claim, then choose an HCP Project you want to migrate the registries to. Click the **Reclaim** button.

Once you have reclaimed your Vagrant Cloud registries, go to your Registries page to interact with your migrated registries.

## Troubleshooting

If your accounts are linked and you still have no claimable registries, you can confirm that your Vagrant Cloud organization has been migrated. Check your **Organizations** tab in Vagrant Cloud to ensure your organizations are not still in Vagrant Cloud.

If you are unable to access your transferred registries, or if you have linked your accounts and there are organizations missing from both Vagrant Cloud and your Unclaimed Registries page, [contact support](/vagrant/intro/support) for assistance.
