# hcp iam service-principals create

Command: `hcp iam service-principals create` 

The `hcp iam service-principals create` command creates a new service
principal.

Once a service principal is created, access to the service principal can be
granted by generating keys using the `hcp iam service-principals keys create`
command or by federating access using an external workload identity provider
using `hcp iam service-principals workload-identity-provider create`.

Service principals can be created at the organization scope or project scope. It
is recommended to create service principals at the project scope to limit access
to the service principal and to locate the service principal near the resources
it will be accessing.

To create an organization service principal, set the  `--project` flag to `-`.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp iam service-principals create SP_NAME [Optional Flags]
```

## Examples

Create a new service principal:

```shell-session
$ hcp iam service-principals create example-sp
```

Create a new organization service principal:

```shell-session
$ hcp iam service-principals create example-sp --project="-"
```

## Positional arguments

- `SP_NAME` - The name of the service principal to create.
