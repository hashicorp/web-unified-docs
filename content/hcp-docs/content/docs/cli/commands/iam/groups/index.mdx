# hcp iam groups

Command: `hcp iam groups` 

The `hcp iam groups` command group lets you manage HCP groups as well as their
memberships.

Groups help manage users and their access at scale. Each member of a group
inherits the roles granted to that group. This allows assigning many users the
same roles by adding them to a group, rather than creating role bindings for all
individuals that need the same access separately.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp iam groups <command> [Optional Flags]
```

## Command groups

- [`members`](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/iam/groups/members) - Manage group membership.
- [`iam`](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/iam/groups/iam) - Manage a group's IAM policy.
