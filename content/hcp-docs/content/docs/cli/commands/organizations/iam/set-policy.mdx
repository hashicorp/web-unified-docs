# hcp organizations iam set-policy

Command: `hcp organizations iam set-policy` 

The `hcp organizations iam set-policy` command sets the IAM policy for the
organization. Setting the entire policy must be done with great care. If adding
or removing a single principal from the policy, prefer using `hcp organizations
iam add-binding` and the related `hcp organizations iam delete-binding`.

The policy file is expected to be a file encoded in JSON that contains the IAM
policy.

The format for the policy JSON file is an object with the following format:

```json
{
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role_id": "ROLE_ID",
      "members": [
        {
          "member_id": "PRINCIPAL_ID",
          "member_type": "USER" | "GROUP" | "SERVICE_PRINCIPAL"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "etag": "ETAG"
}
```

If set, the etag of the policy must be equal to that of the existing policy. To
view the existing policy and its etag, run `hcp organizations iam read-policy
--format=json`. If unset, the existing policy's etag will be fetched and used.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp organizations iam set-policy --policy-file=PATH [Optional Flags]
```

## Examples

```shell-session

        "member_type": "USER"
      },
      {
        "member_id": "334514c1-4650-4699-891a-a7261fba9607",
        "member_type": "GROUP"
      }
    ]

      {
        "member_id": "efa07942-17e8-4ef4-ae2d-ec51d32a0767",
        "member_type": "SERVICE_PRINCIPAL"
      }
    ]
  }
  ],
  "etag": "14124142"
}
