# hcp profile

Command: `hcp profile` 

The `hcp profile` command group lets you initialize, set, view and unset
properties used by HCP CLI.

A profile is a collection of properties/configuration values that inform the
behavior of `hcp` CLI. To initialize a profile, run `hcp profile init`. You can
create additional profiles using `hcp profile profiles create`.

To switch between profiles, use `hcp profile profiles activate`.

`hcp` has several global flags that have matching profile properties. Examples
are the `project_id` and `core/output_format` properties and their respective
flags `--project` and `--format`. The difference between properties and flags is
that flags apply only on the invoked command, while properties are persistent
across all invocations. Thus profiles allow you to conviently maintain the same
settings across command executions and multiple profiles allow you to easily
switch between different projects and settings.

To run a command using a profile other than the active profile, pass the
`--profile` flag to the command.

```shell-session
$ hcp profile <command> [Optional Flags]
