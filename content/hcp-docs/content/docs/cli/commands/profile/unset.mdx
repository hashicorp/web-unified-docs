# hcp profile unset

Command: `hcp profile unset` 

The `hcp profile unset` command unsets the specified property in your active
profile.

To view all currently set properties, run `hcp profile display`.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp profile unset COMPONENT/PROPERTY [Optional Flags]
```

## Positional arguments

- `COMPONENT/PROPERTY` - Property to be unset. Note that `COMPONENT/` is optional when referring to
	top-level profile fields, i.e., such as `organization_id` and `project_id`.
	
	Using component names is required for setting other properties like
	`core/output_format`. Consult the Available Properties section below for a
	comprehensive list of properties.

## Available Properties
* `organization_id`
    * Organization ID of the HCP organization to operate on.

* `project_id`
    * Project ID of the HCP project to operate on by default. This can be overridden
    by using the global `--project` flag.

* `core`

    * `no_color` - If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the terminal.

    * `output_format` - Default output format for `hcp` commands. This is the equivalent of using the
    global `--format` flag. Supported output formats: `pretty`, `table`, and `json`.

    * `quiet` - If True, prompts will be disabled and output will be minimized.

    * `verbosity` - Default logging verbosity for `hcp` commands. This is the equivalent of using
    the global `--verbosity` flag. Supported log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`,
    `warn`, and `error`.

* `vault-secrets`

    * `app` - HCP Vault Secrets application name to operate on by default.
