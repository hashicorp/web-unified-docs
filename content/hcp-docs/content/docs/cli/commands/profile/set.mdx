# hcp profile set

Command: `hcp profile set` 

The `hcp profile set` command sets the specified property in your active
profile. A property governs the behavior of a specific aspect of the HCP CLI.
This could be setting the organization and project to target, or configuring the
default output format across commands.

To view all currently set properties, run `hcp profile display` or run `hcp
profile read` to read the value of an individual property.

To unset properties, use `hcp profile unset`.

HCP CLI comes with a default profile but supports multiple. To create multiple
configurations, use `hcp profile profiles create`, and `hcp profile profiles
activate` to switch between them.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp profile set COMPONENT/PROPERTY VALUE [Optional Flags]
```

## Positional arguments

- `COMPONENT/PROPERTY` - Property to be set. Note that `COMPONENT/` is optional when referring to
	top-level profile fields, i.e., such as `organization_id` and `project_id`.
	
	Using component names is required for setting other properties like
	`core/output_format`. Consult the Available Properties section below for a
	comprehensive list of properties.

- `VALUE` - Value to be set.

## Available Properties
* `organization_id`
    * Organization ID of the HCP organization to operate on.

* `project_id`
    * Project ID of the HCP project to operate on by default. This can be overridden
    by using the global `--project` flag.

* `core`

    * `no_color` - If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the terminal.

    * `output_format` - Default output format for `hcp` commands. This is the equivalent of using the
    global `--format` flag. Supported output formats: `pretty`, `table`, and `json`.

    * `quiet` - If True, prompts will be disabled and output will be minimized.

    * `verbosity` - Default logging verbosity for `hcp` commands. This is the equivalent of using
    the global `--verbosity` flag. Supported log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`,
    `warn`, and `error`.

* `vault-secrets`

    * `app` - HCP Vault Secrets application name to operate on by default.
