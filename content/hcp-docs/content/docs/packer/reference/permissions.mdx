# HCP Packer permissions

This topic provides reference information about user permissions for HCP Packer. Permissions are role-based access controls (RBAC) inherited from 
the HCP organization or HCP project. Refer to the [global user permissions reference](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users#user-permissions) 
for additional information about HCP RBAC.

## Introduction 
            
HCP users have different level of permissions to perform actions in HCP Packer depending on the assigned roles. Users inherit permissions based on 
their roles at either the [organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs), [project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects), or HCP Packer bucket level. 

### Resolution for multiple roles

When a user account is assigned multiple roles, the permission set from each role is additive. For
example, if `userA` has the HCP project `contributor` role, and is then given the
`viewer` role in HCP Packer `bucketA`, the effective permission for `userA` in `bucketA` is `contributor`.

In a different scenario, if `userB` has the HCP project `viewer` role, and is then given the
`contributor` role in HCP Packer `bucketA`, the effective permission for `userB` in `bucketA` is `contributor`. 

The effective HCP Packer permissions for the users from both example scenarios are: 
- The `userA` has `contributor` [registry permissions](#hcp-packer-permissions) at the project level, and `contributor` [bucket permissions](#hcp-packer-permissions) at the `bucketA` level.
- The `userB` has `viewer` [registry permissions](#hcp-packer-permissions) at the project level, and `contributor` [bucket permissions](#hcp-packer-permissions) at the `bucketA` level.

## Registry permissions 

The following table describes HCP Packer registry permissions inherited based on 
user's role at either the [organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs) or [project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) level.
