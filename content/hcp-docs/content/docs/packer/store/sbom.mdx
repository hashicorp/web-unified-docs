# Manage artifact software bill of materials

This topic describes how to upload software bill of materials (SBOM) files and associate them with an artifact version in the HCP Packer registry. 

## Requirements

A [Standard edition registry](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/packer/pricing) is required to upload and download SBOM files. Refer to [Manage registry](/hcp/docs/packer/manage-registry) for details about viewing and changing your registry tier.

## Overview

A software bill of materials stores a reference of an artifact's package metadata, and is useful to help with security and compliance audits. You can upload existing SBOM files to HCP Packer and associate them with an artifact version with the [`hcp-sbom` provisioner](/packer/docs/provisioners/hcp-sbom) or the [HCP Packer registry API](/hcp/api-docs/packer). 

## Create a software bill of materials

Packer does not generate SBOM files, so you must use a third-party tool to create them. HCP Packer requires SBOM files to be in either [SPDX](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest) or [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) format. For an example Packer template that uses the provisioner, refer to the [Track Packer artifact package bill of materials](/packer/tutorials/hcp/track-artifact-package-metadata) tutorial.

## Upload the software bill of materials

You can upload SBOM files to the HCP Packer registry using either the `hcp-sbom` provisioner or by using the HCP Packer API.

### Upload using the provisioner

You can use the `hcp-sbom` provisioner in your Packer template to upload an SBOM from your artifact to the HCP Packer registry. 

1. Add the `hcp-sbom` provisioner to your Packer template, for example: 

  ```hcl
  provisioner "hcp-sbom" {
    source = "/tmp/sbom-cyclonedx-0.3.json"
  }
  ```

  Refer to the [`hcp-sbom` provisioner reference](/packer/docs/provisioners/hcp-sbom) for more information.

1. Run the `packer init` command to install the provisioner.
1. Run `packer build` to upload the SBOM file.

### Upload using the API

Refer to the [`UploadSboms` API reference](/hcp/api-docs/packer#PackerService_UploadSbom) for more information on this API endpoint

## Download artifact software bill of materials

You can view information about an SBOM and download SBOM files from the HCP Packer registry using the UI or the API.

### View packages in HCP Packer

In the artifact version build, HCP Packer lists all packages, their version, and the SBOM they're included in under the **Packages** section. You can filter packages by name with the **Search package names** text box.

### Download from the UI

1. Open the artifact version overview page.
1. Click the **Download SBOM** drop-down and choose the SBOM you want to download.

### Download using the API 

Send a `GET` request to the `/GetSbom` HCP Packer API endpoint to download SBOM files using the [HCP Packer registry API](/hcp/api-docs/packer#PackerService_GetSbom).
