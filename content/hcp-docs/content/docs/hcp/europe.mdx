# HCP Europe

With HCP Europe, your resources are hosted, managed, and billed separately to meet European data residency requirements.

For more information about using HCP Terraform in the European region, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe).

## HCP Europe portal

[The HCP Europe portal](https://portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp.com/) is available at a distinct URL:

```plaintext
https://portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp.com/
```

Use the portal to sign in to your HCP Europe account. Then you can access and manage your HCP Europe resources from a compatible web browser.

### Change HCP geography

When you visit [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp.com), you have the option to change your geography before you sign in to your account.

Under **Change geography**, use the selector to switch between the global and Europe HCP portals.

## Product availability

The following table lists the current availability of HCP services in each region.

| Service         | Global availability | Europe availability |

| Waypoint        | &#9989;             | &#9989;             |

We plan to add support for more services to HCP Europe over time, until all services are available in both regions.

## Benefits

HCP Europe provides the following benefits to managing your cloud deployments:

- **Isolated HCP footprints**: A unique HCP footprint specific to the European geography ensures complete isolation from the existing global HCP footprint.
- **Data residency**: User-generated data remains within European borders so that you can ensure compliance with data sovereignty regulations and reduce potential risks associated with cross-border data transfers.
- **Enhanced user control**: Organizations have granular control over user accounts within Europe to manage access, permissions, and account activities more precisely.

HCP Europe provides the same reliability and uninterrupted access to data as the global HCP platform. To provide 24-hour support, data from HCP Europe may be accessed from members of our support team in other regions.

To learn more about our data governance policies, visit the [HashiCorp EU Trust Center](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/privacy/hcp-data-privacy).

## Accounts

You must create a new HCP account and organization to use with HCP Europe. You can use the same email address to sign up for your HCP Europe account that you used for your global account, but you cannot connect or migrate existing HCP accounts from the global geography to HCP Europe.

European accounts combine HCP and HCP Terraform (formerly Terraform Cloud) administration by default. When you create groups or invite users in HCP Terraform, the HCP platform automatically manages these resources. Similarly, when you change permissions in the HCP platform, it also affects HCP Terraform accounts.

## Billing

HCP Europe bills resources separately from the global HCP resources, even if you already have an existing payment method set up for the global HCP platform.

HCP Europe supports the following types of accounts:

- Trial accounts
- Contract plans

HCP Europe does not support pay-as-you-go billing at this time.

## Constraints and limitations

HCP Europe has the following constraints:

- You can only delete an organization through HCP Support.
- Each HCP Europe organization is limited to 100 projects.
- You must delete all workspaces within a project before you can delete a project.
- You cannot use European HCP service principals with the HCP Terraform APIs.
- HCP Europe does not support the HCP CLI at this time.
- HCP Europe organizations do not support team notifications for groups.
- If you remove and then re-add a user to your organization, it may cause unexpected permissions behavior. Contact HCP Support for more information.
