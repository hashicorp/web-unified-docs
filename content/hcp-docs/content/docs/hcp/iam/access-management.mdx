# Access Management

This topic describes HCP's access management features. You can set roles and permissions at either the _organization level_ , _project level_ or _resource level_ to secure access to HCP resources.

## Roles and permissions

@include '/hcp-administration/permission-intro.mdx'

## Add new role assignment

Users with the `owner` role in an organization can add and assign roles at a fine-grained level using the HCP platform.

1. At the top, click the dropdown to open the organization and project selector. Select **View all organizations**.
1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. Click **Add new assignment**. If you are not an organization's owner, this option does not appear.
1. Enter the user's email address.

You can change the user's role assignment and the service associated with that role assignment using the drop-down menus. When you set a role assignment for all services, it sets the user's role in the organization.

## Organization level roles and permissions

The following table describes the roles and permissions available at the organizational level:

To learn more about each permission, refer to [HCP Terraform organization permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization).

A user can be a part of an organization with no roles assigned directly to them through the [SSO default role settings](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso) or IAM settings. To enforce least-privileged access, new users will have a limited experience within the platform until an Admin assigns either an organization or project role to the user.

## View current role assignments

To view a list of current role assignments in an organization:

1. At the top, click the dropdown to open the organization and project selector. Select **View all organizations**.
1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Access Control (IAM)**.

The **Role assignments** page lists the currently assigned roles, and provides an interface to search and filter the current assignments.

## Project level roles and permissions

The following tables describe role permissions scope to the project level.

From the IAM tab in the HCP UI, you can assign the App Manager, App Secrets Reader, Integration Manager, or Integration Reader roles to Users, Service Principals, and Groups at the Project level.

Refer to the [HCP Vault Secrets](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/permissions)
documentation for more details.
