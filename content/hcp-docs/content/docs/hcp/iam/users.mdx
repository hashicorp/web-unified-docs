# Users

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account for the first
time, the HCP Portal takes you to the [create
organization](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/orgs/create) page to set up
your organization. You can invite additional users to the organization so that
they can access the resources.

This page describes how to add users to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account and manage their access to resources.

## Invite users

Use the following procedure to invite users into your organization using email.
[Organization admin role](#organization-role) is required to invite and manage
users.

@include '/hcp-administration/invite-users.mdx'

## Manage users

@include '/hcp-administration/manage-users.mdx'

## User permissions

@include '/hcp-administration/permission-intro.mdx'

## Access Management
For more information about permissions, the different types of roles and how they can be used within HCP, checkout the [Access Management](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management)  page.
