# Peering connections

You can create a peering connection between HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) and
your virtual private cloud (VPC) in Azure to allow traffic between services.

## Overview

HCP Consul Dedicated and HCP Vault Dedicated uses a peering connections to communicate with the clients
hosted in your Azure environment.

You can create a peering connections from [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) or the
HCP provider in Terraform. For instructions on how to create peering connections
with Terraform, refer to the [HCP provider
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/guides/peering-azure).

## Requirements

- An Azure account ID
- The ID of the VNet you wish to connect
- VNets must be configured with [RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) or [RFC6598 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598) IP addresses.

## Create peering connections

To set up a peering connection, you need to configure the connection request in
HCP and then configure a corresponding request in Azure.

<Note title="Hub and spoke topology">

When peering an HVN with an Azure hub and spoke topology network, there are
additional considerations to ensure traffic is properly routed from spoke
networks.

Refer to the [Hub and spoke
options](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hub-spoke-options) documentation for
more information.

</Note>

### Configure the connection request in HCP

@include '/hcp-network/configure-azure-connection.mdx'

The HVN sends a peering connection request to Azure. The peering request expires
after seven days. The status of the connection appears as pending until either
the connection process is completed or the request expires.

### Accept the connection request in Azure

HCP generates terminal commands that you can copy and paste into your Azure CLI
to configure the corresponding connection request. HCP also provides links to
the Azure documentation if you prefer to use the Azure browser interface.

@include '/hcp-network/complete-azure-connection.mdx'

You can also create the second request from the Azure console. For information
about creating VNet peering connections, refer to the [Azure
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

## Next steps

The HVN peering connection does not contain routing information. Once the
connection is active, you can add a route for all or part of the VNet CIDR
range. For more details, refer to
[Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/routes).
