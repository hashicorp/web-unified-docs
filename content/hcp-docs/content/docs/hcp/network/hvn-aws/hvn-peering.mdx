# Peering connections

You can create a peering connection between HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) and
your virtual private cloud (VPC) in AWS to allow traffic between services.

## Overview

HCP Consul Dedicated and HCP Vault Dedicated uses a peering connections to communicate with the clients
hosted in your AWS environment.

You can create a peering connections from [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) or the
HCP provider in Terraform. For instructions on how to create peering connections
with Terraform, refer to the [HCP provider
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/aws_network_peering).

For larger environments, we recommend connecting HCP to your VPCs through a [transit
gateway](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/tgw-attach).

## Requirements

- An AWS account ID
- The ID of the VPC you wish to connect
- VPCs must be configured with [RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) or [RFC6598 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598) IP addresses.
- No active PrivateLink service is associated with the HVN

## Create peering connections

There are two methods to create a peering connection between the HCP HVN and AWS VPC - manual or automated.

The automated method connects to your AWS account and launches a CloudFormation template to complete the peering configuration.
The CloudFormation template handles creating the peering request, accepting the peering request, and creating the
necessary routes between the HVN and VPC.

The manual process will require you to perform each step in your HCP and AWS accounts.
