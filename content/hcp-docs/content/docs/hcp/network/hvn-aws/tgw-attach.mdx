# Transit gateway attachments

You can create transit gateway attachments to connect a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) to an AWS transit gateway.
* A _transit gateway_ is an AWS component that acts as a network transit hub in your AWS environment.
* A _transit gateway attachment_ is a component in HCP that connects your HVN to a transit gateway in AWS.

## Overview

The following procedure describes how to connect clusters in HCP to resources deployed to AWS:
1. Connect one or more VPCs in your AWS network to your transit gateway.
1. Create a _resource share_ using the AWS Resource Access Manager. The transit gateway and resource share must exist in the same region as the HVN you want to connect to.
1. Create a transit gateway attachment in HCP. The platform identifies the shared resource using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the transit gateway ID.
1. HCP initiates a request to AWS for access to the resources. You must approve the attachment request in the AWS account before HCP can route traffic through the transit gateway.
1. Configure routes to direct traffic between the transit gateway attachment and the transit gateway.

You can create a transit gateway attachment in HCP or you can use the HCP Terraform provider. For instructions on how to create transit gateway attachments with Terraform, refer to the [HCP provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/aws_transit_gateway_attachment).

## Requirements

Before you create a transit gateway attachment, you need the following information:

* AWS account ID
* AWS transit gateway ID
* ARN of the resource share in AWS
* No active PrivateLink service is associated with the HVN

The HCP interface provides links and other onscreen assistance to help you find this information. For additional details on where to find this information, refer to the AWS Documentation.

## Create a transit gateway attachment

The HCP interface provides guided steps to help you transit gateway attachments. You can follow the command line or the web UI workflow.

## AWS Cloud WAN considerations

Cloud WAN Attachments are not currently supported directly with HVNs, but peering a Transit Gateway Attachment to a Cloud WAN Segment 
is supported by Amazon Web Services and would allow for connectivity to the HVN. For more information, refer to the AWS Documentation for 
[Cloud WAN Peerings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-peerings.html) and 
[TGW Peerings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-peering.html).

## Next steps

After you create the attachment, you must create a route to direct traffic to
your VPCs. For more information, refer to [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/routes).
