# HCP Account

This page explains how to create an account in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) and manage your account settings.

## Account geography

To meet data residency requirements, HCP requires separate accounts for the global and European geographies.

To create a global HCP account, sign up on [the HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/). To an HCP Europe account, sign up on [the HCP Europe portal](https://portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp.com/).

For more information, refer to [HCP Europe](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe).

## Create an HCP Account

You can create an HCP account using one of the following methods:

- Email and password
- [Single Sign-On](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/sso) through GitHub or an identity provider configured for an [HCP organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs)

You can also use your HCP credentials to sign in to the following HashiCorp products and educational resources:
