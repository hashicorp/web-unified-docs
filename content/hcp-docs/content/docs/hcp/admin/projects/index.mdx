# Projects

Projects are lightweight containers for resources or use cases that require similar access. An organization contains one or more projects. HCP resources such as [HashiCorp Virtual Networks
(HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) and server clusters reside within Projects.

Use projects to segment access within an organization. For example, projects can separate teams, use cases, or environments, such as development, staging, and production. The billing summary reports usage per project. 

Here are important characteristics about HCP projects:

- _Global_ [HCP service quotas](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support#service-quotas) remain at the
  organization level and they are not enforced per project.

- An [organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs) can contain 1 or more projects. 

   <Note>

   Refer the [HCP
   Support](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support) page to learn more about the service
   quotas.

   </Note>

- HCP resource names (e.g. cluster name) are unique per project and not per
  organization.

- You cannot deploy an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster if an
  HVN belongs to a different project.

- To delete a project, all resources under the project must be deleted or
  deactivated first. See the [manage resources](#manage-resources) section.

### Use Cases 
Taking advantage of segregating access within your organization via projects is the best way to enforce least privileged access. Deploying all HCP services or resources within one project, can lead to several unintended consequences. 

- Increased likelihood of over privileging identities within the project
- Project billing invoices may become less useful due to the high amount of resource types and use cases represented within the project.
- Self Service use cases become harder to support over time because of the challenges of isolating access and control among many disparate identities in one project. 

## Create a project

Users with organization contributor, admin, or owner roles can create new
projects. If an organization contributor creates a new project, the user
automatically becomes the admin of that project. (Refer to the [User
Permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#user-permissions) for information about
the roles you can assign.)

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your
   organization.

   <Note>

   If you have logged in before, the portal opens the last project you were in.
   Navigate back to the organization level from the breadcrumbs, or click on the
   HashiCorp icon at the top-left to choose your organization.
   
   </Note>

1. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.

1. Click **+ Create project**.

1. Enter the **Project name** and **Project description**.

1. Click **Create project** to complete.


## Manage projects

Users with project admin role can edit the existing project name and
description, or delete the project. (Refer to the [User
Permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#user-permissions) for information about
the roles you can assign.)

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your
   organization.

1. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.

1. Expand the menu next to the project you wish to modify, and select **Edit
   project** to edit the project name or description, or select **Delete** to
   delete the project.

1. Select **View project** will take you to the project setting page where you
   can find the **project ID**.


## Manage resources

![HCP Organization Structure](/img/docs/hcp-core/diagram-hcp_organization_project-resources.png)

A resource is any item that the access management system controls access to. Examples of resources are a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, HCP Packer Bucket, HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) or a HCP Vault Secret App.   The **Active Resources** page lists all resources created in the project. To delete a project, all resources must be deleted. If an resource exists, HCP will block users from deleting the project. This page helps you to identify what resources are still in the project.
