# Organizations

This page describes how to create and manage an organization in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

## Introduction

An _organization_ is a top-level entity in HCP for organizing resources. It contains one or more
[HCP projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects), which separate access to resources such as [HashiCorp Virtual Networks (HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) according to [user permissions](/hcp/docs/iam/users#user-permissions).

Users can be a member of multiple organizations if invited by the admin of other organizations. However, you can only create and own one organization for your HCP account.

An organization can have up to 100 projects.

## Create an organization

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account, [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) takes you to a guided worfklow.

1. Select the type of organization you want to create, either **Business** or **Personal**.
1. Specify the name, address, and country of origin for your organization. The name must be unique. If another organization is already using the name, you will recieve a prompt to choose a different one.
1. Accept the terms and conditions. Then click **Create organization**.

After you create your organization, you can [invite users to your organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#invite-users) and start creating HCP resources.

## Locate the organization ID

To locate the organization ID:

1. At the bottom left, click the name of the current organization to open the organization and project selector.
1. Select an organization to open the organization's dashboard.
1. From the organization's dashboard, click **Organization settings**.
1. To copy the **Organization ID**, click the clipboard icon next to the ID.

## Manage an organization

To change your organization's name:

1. Sign in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).
1. From the organization's dashboard, click **Organization settings**.
1. At the top-right, click **Manage**, and then click **Rename organization**.
1. Enter a new organization name. The name must contain between 3 and 40 characters, and it may include ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. The name must be unique. If another organization is already using the name, you will receive a prompt to choose a different one.
1. Click **Save**.

You may encounter an `Organization name update failed` error when managing an HCP organization from an HCP Terraform workspace. Refresh the organization's settings page from HCP Terraform, and the name change should take effect.
