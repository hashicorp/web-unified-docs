# Organizations

This page describes how to create and manage an organization in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

## Introduction

An _organization_ is a top-level entity in HCP for organizing resources. It contains one or more
[HCP projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects), which separate access to resources such as [HashiCorp Virtual Networks (HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) according to [user permissions](/hcp/docs/iam/users#user-permissions).

An organization can have up to 100 projects.

Users can be a member of multiple organizations.

Organizations can have a maximum of 3 users with the `owner` role. You can add and delete organization owners over time, but organizations require at least 1 owner at all times.

## Create an organization

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account, [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) takes you to a guided worfklow.

1. Select the type of organization you want to create, either **Business** or **Personal**.
1. Specify the name, address, and country of origin for your organization. The name must be unique. If another organization is already using the name, you will recieve a prompt to choose a different one.
1. Accept the terms and conditions. Then click **Create organization**.

After you create your organization, you can [invite users to your organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#invite-users) and start creating HCP resources.

1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Organization settings**.
1. Click the clipboard icon next to the ID to copy the **Organization ID**.

## Find organization owners

An organization can have 1-3 users with the `owner` role. Owners can change, but there must always be at least 1 owner per organization.

To find the organization's current owners:

1. At the top, click the dropdown to open the organization and project selector. Select **View all organizations**.
1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Organization settings**.

You may encounter an `Organization name update failed` error when managing an HCP organization from an HCP Terraform workspace. Refresh the organization's settings page from HCP Terraform, and the name change should take effect.
