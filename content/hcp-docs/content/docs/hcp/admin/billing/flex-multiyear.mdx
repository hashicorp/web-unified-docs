# Flex Multiyear

This topic provides an overview of Flex Multiyear contracts, including setup and activation.

## What is Flex Multiyear?

Flex Multiyear is a contract-based billing model that provides access to HCP services at a discount on list prices.
Available services include HCP Terraform, HCP Packer, HCP Vault Dedicated, HCP Vault Secrets, and HCP Boundary.

With Flex Multiyear, you commit a specific amount of spend upfront that you have up to three years to use.
The balance from your committed spend is drawn down over time based on your consumption of HCP services.

Flex Multiyear has a minimum contract size. For additional information, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales).

## Set up a Flex Multiyear contract

During the sales process, you should provide your HashiCorp Account Manager with:
1. A technical contact who has the privileges necessary to complete the [self-activation process](#activate-your-contract)
1. If using HCP Terraform: the names of existing HCP Terraform organizations you intend to use with HCP on Flex Multiyear

After completion of the sales process, the technical contract must complete the [self-activation process](#activate-your-contract)
to transition your intended HCP organization to the Flex Multiyear billing model.

Consider [configuring a backup credit card](#configure-a-post-contract-payment-method)
to avoid disruption of service if your Flex Multiyear balance is depleted or contract expires
without another Flex Multiyear contract in place.

### HCP Terraform and Flex Multiyear

<Highlight title="Previous HCP Terraform contract customers">

If you have HCP Terraform Organization(s) that have been operating on a contract type other than Flex,
please follow the
[HCP Terraform Organization Flex activation documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/activate-flex)
instead so that each HCP Terraform Organization is linked to your HCP Organization on Flex.
That Terraform-specific Flex activation documentation includes a step that directs
you to follow the general Flex activation steps below.

</Highlight>

To use your existing HCP Terraform organizations with HCP on Flex Multiyear,
you should provide your HCP Terraform organization name(s) to your account manager during the sales process.

If you cannot edit your HCP Terraform Organization's plan as described in the
[Terraform-specific Flex activation documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/activate-flex#step-5-edit-the-hcp-terraform-organization-plan),
[contact support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the
HCP Terraform Organization's details so they can enable you to edit its plan.

### Activate your contract

For an HCP organization not already on Flex, you must self-activate your Flex Multiyear contract
to transition your HCP organization to Flex.

The self-activation process begins after the Flex Multiyear contract is signed.
HashiCorp will automatically generate a contract activation code that references your contract details
and email it to the technical contact specified to your HashiCorp Sales Account Manager during the sales process.
The technical contact must be a user within the applicable HCP organization with an
[organizational admin or billing admin role](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#organization).

Please follow the steps below to complete the activation process:
1. **Receive the activation email:** You (designated technical contract) will receive an email titled
   "Action required: Activate your contract". The email contains information about the Flex Multiyear contract,
   the contract activation code, and an "Activate contract" link that will take you to the HCP portal when clicked.
1. **Select the applicable HCP organization:** Click the email's "Activate contract" link to open the HCP portal.
   You will be presented with a list of eligible HCP organizations. Select the HCP organization you intend to apply
   the Flex Multiyear contract to.
1. **Enter the contract activation code:** On the "add activation code" page, enter the activation code found in the activation email.
1. **Review and confirm activation:** On the "confirm activation" page, double-check that the named HCP organization is
   the correct organization to apply the Flex Multiyear contract to. You **cannot undo** or reassign an activated Flex Multiyear contract.
   Once you are sure you have selected the correct HCP organization, click "Activate contract".
1. **Wait one hour:** After you click "Activate contract", you will be redirected back to the Account Summary page with a confirmation message.
   You will also receive an email confirmation regarding the activation status.
   Your HCP organization will transition to the Flex Multiyear billing model within the next hour.
   At that time, your Flex Multiyear balance will be available to view on the HCP organization's dashboard.
1. **Complete HCP Terraform Flex activation if needed:** If you have existing HCP
   Terraform Organizations and have not already associated them with your
   HCP Organization on Flex, please follow the
   [HCP Terraform Organization Flex activation documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/activate-flex).

There is no self-activation process for Flex Multiyear recommit contracts.
The self-activation process is only needed for the initial transition of your HCP Organization
to the Flex Multiyear billing model.

### Configure a post-contract payment method

If your Flex Multiyear balance is depleted or contract expires without another Flex Multiyear contract in place,
your HCP organization will transition to [Pay-as-you-Go](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/pay-as-you-go) (PAYG).
If there is no credit card configured when a PAYG payment is due, your account will be considered delinquent.
If your account remains delinquent, we may suspend or terminate your resources consistent with the
[EULA for HashiCorp Cloud Software](https://eula.hashicorp.com/OnlineAgreements.pdf).

Therefore, consider configuring a backup credit card now in case your HCP organization transitions to PAYG
at the end of a Flex Multiyear contract. To learn more about configuring a backup credit card,
refer to the [PAYG manage payment method](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/pay-as-you-go#manage-payment-method) documentation.

To avoid a transition to PAYG entirely, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales)
in advance of your Flex Multiyear balance approaching depletion or expiry.
