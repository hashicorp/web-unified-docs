# Pay-as-you-Go (PAYG)

This topic provides an overview of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) billing model,
including how to add, change, and remove a credit card payment method.

## PAYG Overview

Pay-as-you-Go (PAYG) is a no commitment billing model that provides access to HCP services at list prices.

To move from the [trial billing model](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#trial) to PAYG, [add a credit card as a payment method](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/pay-as-you-go#add-a-credit-card).

Your organization's accrued usage for the month will be charged on the first day of the following calendar month.
HCP sends an invoice copy to the email address specified when setting up the credit card.
You can change the email address by editing the credit card details in the 'Billing' tab.
Invoices and receipts are also available to download from the billing section of the HCP portal.

If your organization has remaining [trial](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#trial) credits,
those will be drawn down before charges accrue to your credit card.

If the credit card on file is expired or unable to process payment, the following will occur:
- HCP will freeze your ability to deploy additional resources.
- We will retry payment several times over the next few weeks and notify you at the specified billing email address.
- If your account remains delinquent, we may suspend or terminate your resources consistent with the
  [EULA for HashiCorp Cloud Software](https://eula.hashicorp.com/OnlineAgreements.pdf).

## Manage payment method

PAYG requires a credit card as a payment method. A credit card can be added, changed, or removed from the HCP portal.
HCP organizations on a Flex Multiyear contract can also configure a credit card as a backup in case they transition to PAYG in the future.

### Add a credit card

1. Open your Project or Organization dashboard and click on the **View billing** link in the Billing summary tile.
1. Click **Payment methods** in the sidebar.
1. Click **Add credit card** and enter your billing information when prompted.

HCP generates your final invoice and the remainder of your usage. If your organization does not have any remaining credits or another payment method, you will not be able to deploy any new paid resources.

## Understanding your payment status

To find the payment status for each monthly PAYG plan statement, navigate to your organization's "Monthly summaries" page.

1. From the "Organization overview," click **Billing**. 
1. Click **Monthly summaries** . 

The following list describes each payment status that may appear when reviewing your pay-as-you-go monthly summaries:

- **Payment Due**: This status indicates that there is an outstanding amount that needs to be paid by the end of the billing cycle. Your card on file will be automatically charged at the end of the month.
- **Good Standing**: This status indicates that the statement has been paid in full and there are no outstanding charges.
- **Overdue**: This status indicates that the payment for your statement was not received by the due date. Ensure you address overdue payments to avoid any interruptions to your services.
- **Void**: This status indicates that the transaction was canceled or invalidated. No action is required from your end.
- **Payment Pending**: This status indicates that a payment is in progress. After the payment is processed successfully, your status will be updated to `Good Standing`.
