# Pricing Definitions

This topic provides definitions for HCP usage-based pricing that applies to the trial, PAYG, and Flex Multiyear billing models.

## Usage-Based Pricing

Usage-based pricing applies to the trial, PAYG, and Flex Multiyear billing models.

On your HCP organization's billing model, every available HCP service has one or more billing metrics.
These billing metrics are metered by incremental count or by time,
with usage and costs accrued from the start of the month updated hourly in the billing page with up to a 30 minute delay.
For example, by 10:30 am, the usage summary and balance will reflect charges for hours 9 am to 10 am.

The usage summary values are estimates until the statement is finalized at the end of the month.
This allows for HCP to backfill any missing data.

## Billable Metrics

Each HCP service has:

- One or more billable metrics
- One or more user-selected service attribes that affect the unit price per billable metric, such as edition (Essentials, Standard, Premium) or cluster size

Each billable metric has:

- A name and definition
- A unit price per rating period

The unit price is exclusive of taxes unless otherwise specified.
The rating period for the unit price is either:

- **Hourly:** Each unit during the rated hour accrues the stated hourly cost.
- **Monthly:** Each incremental unit during the rated hour accrues the stated monthly cost. The unit count resets to zero at the start of each month.

The sections below provide the billable metric definitions for HCP services.

### HCP Terraform

#### Definitions

- **HCP Terraform Organization (HCP Terraform Org):** A unique, top-level entity of HCP Terraform that contains resources, users, and administrative policies.
  It serves as an access control boundary that isolates resources for security.
  One or multiple HCP Terraform Organization(s) can be associated with a single HCP Org and the associated HCP Org serves as a billing boundary for costs.
- **HCP organization (HCP Org):** A unique, top-level entity that contains resources, users, and administrative policies
  that serves as an access control boundary that isolates resources for security and a billing boundary for costs.
- **Resource:** A resource block in a HCP Terraform configuration and declares one or more infrastructure objects.
  Each infrastructure object, including but not limited to “Local Only” Resources, counts as a single Resource.
- **Resource Under Management (RUM)** or **Managed Resource:** A Resource in a HCP Terraform managed state file
  starting from the first time a Terraform plan or Terraform apply run is performed on the Resource, and/or the resource is provisioned,
  and where mode = `managed` in the state file. "Null Resources" are excluded from the Managed Resource.
- **Null Resources:** A specific type of Resource defined as `null_resource` or `terraform_data` resource in a HCP Terraform managed state file
  that are part of the standard resources under management lifecycle, but intentionally take no action.
- **Hourly Peak Managed Resources:** The sum of the maximum number of concurrent "Managed Resources" of each HCP Terraform Org that exist in an hourly billing period.

#### Pricing

Usage-based billing charges for HCP Terraform usage of Resources Under Management (RUM) based on the total number of **Hourly Peak Managed Resources**
aggregated across all HCP Terraform Orgs linked to a single HCP org, within a billing hour.
The rate of each RUM is determined by the product edition.
