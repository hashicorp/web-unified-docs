# What is HCP?

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) is a fully-managed platform offering HashiCorp products-as-a-service. HCP removes the management overhead associated with deploying and maintaining HashiCorp products so that you can focus on reaping the products' benefits. 

HCP enables you to easily launch and operate Consul, Vault, and other HashiCorp services on a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN). An HVN connects to resources on your cloud infrastructure. Shared platform functionality such as log in, access control, and billing provide centralized account and organization management. You can manage HCP assets from the web portal interface or using the Terraform provider.

## How does HCP Work?

The following diagram shows the basic workflow through both the HCP and HCP Terraform portals:

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) has two main planes for interacting with the platform.

### Control Plane

The _control plane_ refers to the systems that control your product deployments.
You can initiate operations such as user management, product deployment, as well as monitoring and maintenance operations. 
You can initiate operations in [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) to interact with your deployed resources
(e.g., HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN), Consul, Vault).

### Data Plane

The _data plane_ consists of your resource deployments on the cloud platforms you use and are managed by the HashiCorp SRE team. 
HCP has one data plane for hosting multiple tenants, also called _organizations_. You can create as many organizations as necessary to meet your goals. 
Organizations are isolated and secured from other organizations.

The HCP data plane is hosted on each supported cloud provider. 
Each component in the data plane is deployed into separately a managed Virtual Private Connection (VPC) on the host cloud. 
The VPC is managed by HashiCorp but is unique to each user. Consul, Vault, and other assets are always separated into their own VPCs. 
You can create as many additional VPCs as needed, but you must have at least one to deploy Consul or Vault. 
HCP automatically handles the data plane when you create a new HVN.
