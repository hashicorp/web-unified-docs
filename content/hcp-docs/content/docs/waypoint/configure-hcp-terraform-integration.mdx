# Configure HCP Terraform integration

This page describes how to configure HCP Waypoint to interact with your HCP Terraform organization. Platform engineers often perform this task.

## Overview

HCP Waypoint templates and add-on definitions both leverage HCP Terraform no-code modules to deploy applications and their underlying infrastructure. As a result, you must provide HCP Waypoint with your HCP Terraform organization name and team token so it can connect to HCP Terraform.

When an application developer uses a template or installs an add-on, HCP Waypoint calls the HCP Terraform API to create a new workspace and trigger an HCP Terraform run. When an application developer destroys an application or uninstalls an add-on, HCP Waypoint triggers a destroy run and deletes the workspace from HCP Terraform.

You must configure HCP Waypoint with HCP Terraform before you can create or use an HCP Waypoint template or add-on.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP account with HCP Waypoint enabled. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.
- An HCP Terraform organization on the **Standard edition**. HCP Terraform must be Standard edition to use HCP Terraform no-code modules and the private module registry.

## Create a team token in HCP Terraform

<Note>

In HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organizations, you manage user access through HCP groups. HCP Terraform inherits groups and roles from HCP. If you are in an HCP Europe organization, create a group and [group API token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#group-api-tokens) instead of a team token for this step. To learn more, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe).

</Note>

Create a dedicated HCP Terraform team and team token for HCP Waypoint that only has access to HCP Terraform projects you intend to deploy to. Refer to [Team API tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens) in the Terraform documentation for information about creating team tokens.

The token must have the following project team permissions:

- Read the project
- Create workspaces
- Delete workspaces
- Apply runs
- Read and write variables
- Output only access to state

For more information about required permissions, refer to [HCP Terraform token permissions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/reference/permissions#hcp-terraform-token-permissions).

## Configure HCP Waypoint

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Enter the HCP Terraform team token you created in [Create a team token in HCP Terraform](#create-a-team-token-in-hcp-terraform).
1. Select the name of the HCP Terraform organization.
1. Click **Save**.
