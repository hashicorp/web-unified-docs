# Create and manage actions

This page describes how to create HCP Waypoint actions and attach them to HCP Waypoint templates and applications. Platform engineers often perform these tasks. Refer to [Actions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/actions) for additional information.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP account with HCP Waypoint enabled. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.

## Create an action

To create an action, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Actions** in the sidebar, then click **Create an action**.
1. Enter an **Action name** and **Description** for the action.
1. Add values to the **Variables** field to create any required local variables for the action. 
1. Optionally, enable the **Enable this value to be defined when the action is triggered** option for each variable you want to choose a value for when you run the action. Refer to [HCP Waypoint variables reference](/hcp/docs/waypoint/reference/variables-actions) for more information.
1. Choose an **Action type** and enter the associated configuration parameters.
1. Click **Create action**.

You can choose from the following action types:

1. **Custom:** This action type configures HCP Waypoint to send an HTTP request to the specified **source URL**. The source URL cannot include a custom port.
1. **Agent:** This action type runs on an HCP Waypoint agent that you manage. Refer to the [create and manage agents](/hcp/docs/waypoint/agent-create) documentation for more information.

For information on using variables in an action, refer to the [action variables reference](/hcp/docs/waypoint/reference/variables-actions) documentation.
