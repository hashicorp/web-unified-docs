# Use an add-on to deploy supporting infrastructure

This page describes how to install an add-on onto an HCP Waypoint application using an add-on definition that has already been created. Application developers often perform this task. Refer to [Add-ons](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/add-ons) for additional information.

## Background

HCP Waypoint add-ons let application developers install supporting infrastructure to their application at any point in the application lifecycle. These components can be infrastructure or services, including databases, storage buckets, secrets engines, search engines, telemetry dashboards, and much more.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP Account. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.

## Install an add-on

To install an add-on, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Applications** in the sidebar, then click on your application.
1. Click **Add-ons** in the application sidebar.
1. Click **Install an add-on**.
1. From the **Available add-ons** page, select the desired add-on you want to install for your application by clicking **Install** or **Install another**.

## Edit an add-on

After you create the add-on, you can only change the add-on name.

To edit an add-on, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Applications** in the sidebar, then select your application.
1. In the application sidebar, click **Add-ons** then **Installed add-ons**.
1. Select the desired add-on to edit then click **Rename**.
1. Enter the new name of the add-on.
1. Click **Save**.

## Uninstall an add-on

Uninstalling an add-on will delete the HCP Terraform workspace and resources associated with the add-on.

To uninstall an add-on definition, complete the following steps:
