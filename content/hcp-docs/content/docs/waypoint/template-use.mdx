# Use a template to deploy and manage an application

This page describes how to create an HCP Waypoint application using a template. Application engineers often perform this task. Refer to [Templates](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/templates) for additional information.

## Background

HCP Waypoint templates are common infrastructure patterns created and maintained by platform engineers. This ensures that any infrastructure provisioned using templates is compliant with your organization's policies for security, finance, scaling, and more. Application developers use these standardized templates to deploy their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP Account. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.

## Create an application

To create an application, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Applications** in the sidebar, then click **Create application**. 
1. Select **Create application with template**, then select a template.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Configure the settings for your new application, including the application name.
1. Click **Create application**.
1. On the next screen, the application overview page, monitor the status of the creation of the application infrastructure, and read through the developer instructions.
1. After the application infrastructure is created, follow the developer instructions to complete the process of deploying your application.

## Update an application

When you update the module version in HCP Terraform, every application deployed from a template that uses that module displays a notification that you can update the application. HCP Waypoint does not automatically update applications. The owner of the application must respond to the update notification to upgrade the application, and HCP Waypoint prompts for values for any new input variables. For more information on updating a no-code module's version, refer to the [designing no-code modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design#updating-a-module-s-version) documentation.

If the new module version has a new input variable, you must first update the template settings to either provide a default value for the variable, or allow the value to be supplied when the template is deployed.

To update an application that has a new version available:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Applications** in the sidebar, then click **View update** when prompted.
1. Enter values for any new input variables.
1. Click **Apply update**.

HCP Waypoint automatically starts a plan run in HCP Terraform. If the plan completes successfully, HCP Waypoint automatically starts an apply run to upgrade the workspace. 

## Delete an application

Deleting an application removes the HCP Terraform workspace and resources associated with the application.

To delete an application, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Applications** in the sidebar, then on an application.
1. Choose **Delete Application** from the **Manage** menu.
1. Enter `DELETE`, and then click **Delete**.
