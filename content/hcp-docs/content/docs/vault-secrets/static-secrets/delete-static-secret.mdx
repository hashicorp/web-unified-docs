# Delete static secrets

Static secrets are created as key/value pairs. Static secrets typically persist
over long periods of time.

documentation](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/get-started/plan-implementation/design-strategry)
for information and tips on app and secret conventions.

## Prerequisites

  role](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/get-started/configure-user-permissions) or
  higher.
- An HCP Vault Secrets [app](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/get-started/create-app) and
  [secret](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/static-secrets/create-static-secret) created.
