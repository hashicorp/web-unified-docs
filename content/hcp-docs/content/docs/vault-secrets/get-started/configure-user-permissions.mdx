# Configure HCP Vault Secrets permissions

Using HCP's [role based access control](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users#types-of-roles), you can configure and manage HCP Vault Secrets permissions granularly at the application level
or more broadly across [projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) and across the [organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs) level.
Assigning permissions at the application level follows the principal of least privilege and restricts access to
other HCP services.

If a user or service principal is assigned multiple roles across various levels (organization, project, application), HCP's [role precedence](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups#role-precedence) enforces the most elevated role assigned to the user.

The following table lists HCP Vault Secrets roles and permissions at the organization and project level. It is a recommended
practice to used the **App manager** role for at least one HCP user or service principal in the
project(s) where HCP Vault Secrets is used to manage integrations.

| HCP Vault Secrets organization and project permissions   |  Viewer  | Contributor |  Admin  | App manager | App secrets reader | Integration manager | Integration reader |

The following table lists HCP Vault Secrets roles and permissions at the application level.
It is a recommended practice to assign application level access to HCP user(s) or service principal(s) who only have an application level role assigned to them
when possible.
