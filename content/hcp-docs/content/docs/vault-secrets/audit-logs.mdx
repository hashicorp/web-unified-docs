# Audit logs

HCP Vault Secrets provides audit logs for all events. These logs capture which users and service principals performed
which operations, such as reading or deleting a secret.

## View audit logs

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/). It opens the last
   project you were in. Choose the target project if it is different.

1. Select **Vault Secrets > Apps**.

1. Select the application name you wish to view.

1. Select **Audit Logs**.

Using the audit logs, you can learn the following information:

- **Event** - the type of operation
- **Triggered By** - the user email or service principal and client IP address from where the request originated
- **Scope** - the scope an operation was executed on. For example, if a new
  application was created, the scope of the event is application.
- **Interface** - the client interface used for the request (such as UI, CLI, API)
- **Timestamp** - the time of the event

<Note title="Application deletion events">

The audit log viewer within the HCP UI is currently at the application level, therefore if an application
is deleted, you can no longer able view its audit logs using the UI. Use log streaming to retain audit log events
for deleted applications.
