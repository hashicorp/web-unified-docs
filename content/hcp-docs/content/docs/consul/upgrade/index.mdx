# Upgrade clusters

@include 'alerts/consul-dedicated-eol.mdx'

HCP provides a dedicated workflow to upgrade the version of an HCP Consul Dedicated cluster. 

For more general information about the upgrade process, refer to [Upgrading Consul](/consul/docs/upgrading) in the Consul documentation.

## Introduction

As described in the Consul documentation, the [general upgrade process for Consul servers](/consul/docs/upgrading/instructions/general-process) consists of the following steps:

1. Create a snapshot of your cluster. If an error occurs during the upgrade process, this snapshot can be used to recover the servers' previous working state.
1. Check the current state of the Raft quorum to find the cluster's leader. Upgrade the binary on the followers first, then upgrade the leader.

You can use HCP to simplify the process of managing Consul versions for HCP Consul Dedicated clusters. When a new version of Consul in released, a badge appears in the Consul overview to inform you if your cluster is out of date or out of support. You can upgrade the cluster's version at a time of your choosing, according to your network's needs.

You can upgrade as new versions of Consul become available or as your networking needs evolve. HashiCorp may upgrade the base host image or version used by your Consul clusters to fix some common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE).

## Cluster versions

To safely and securely manage your Consul clusters, HCP Consul Dedicated follows HashiCorpâ€™s [Support Period Policy](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021185113-Support-Period-and-End-of-Life-EOL-Policy). Be aware of the following aspects of the policy:

- HCP Consul Dedicated offers `n-2` version support for bug fixes and CVEs via new minor releases, where `n` is the latest major release of Consul. You can identify a major release by a change in the first digit (`X`) or the second digit (`Y`) of the Consul version nomenclature (`X.Y.Z`). For example, if the latest release is `1.16.*`, fixes will be available for versions `1.16.*`, `1.15.*`, and `1.14.*`.
- HashiCorp updates HCP Consul Dedicated Consul clusters with CVE patches for clusters that fall within the `n-2` version.
- HashiCorp recommends users keep Consul clusters within two (2) major releases from the latest major release. Doing so ensures that bug fixes and security patches are successfully applied to HCP Consul Dedicated clusters.
- HashiCorp supports [Generally Available (GA) Consul releases](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases) for up to two years from their release date. In some cases, HashiCorp may request that users upgrade to newer releases in order to resolve support requests.

## Upgrade HCP Consul Dedicated cluster's Consul version

<Warning>

Before you upgrade a Consul, we recommend [creating a snapshot of the cluster](/hcp/docs/consul/upgrade/snapshots). If an error occurs or your service network does not function as expected, use the snapshot to restore your cluster to its last working state.

</Warning>

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).
1. Select the organization or project where you created the cluster.
1. Click **Consul**.
1. From the Consul Overview, next to the snapshot you want toupdate, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then **Update version**.
1. Select a version from the dropdown. Then, click **Update now**.

The cluster's status changes to **Updating** as the process takes place.
