# Restore clusters with snapshots

@include 'alerts/consul-dedicated-eol.mdx'

This page describes the process to create and use snapshots, which are backup files for restoring Consul servers to a previous state.

You can [access a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/access) to interact with the [`/snapshot` HTTP API endpoint](/consul/api-docs/snapshot) or the [`consul snapshot` CLI command](/consul/commands/snapshot). Snapshots of HCP Consul Dedicated clusters created using the API and CLI appear in HCP Consul alongside manually created snapshots.

## Create a snapshot on HCP Consul

To create a snapshot of a cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).
1. Select the organization or project where you created the cluster.
1. Click **Consul**.
1. From the Consul Overview, click the cluster ID you want to create a snapshot for.
1. Click **Snapshots** and then **Create snapshot**.
1. Enter a name for the snapshot. Then, click **Create snapshot**.

The time it takes to create the snapshot depends on the size of the cluster. When the process is complete, the snapshot's status changes to **Ready**.

## Restore a cluster

To restore a cluster's Consul servers from a snapshot, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).
1. Select the organization or project where you created the cluster.
1. Click **Consul**.
1. From the Consul Overview, click the cluster ID you want to use to restore the cluster's state.
1. Click **Snapshots**.
1. Next to the snapshot you want to use to restore the cluster, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then **Restore**.
1. Type **RESTORE** in the text box to confirm. Then, click **Restore snapshot**.

By default, HCP creates a snapshot of the cluster before restoring it to a previous version. If you do not want a snapshot of the cluster in this state, uncheck the box before you confirm the restore.

## Rename a snapshot

You can edit the name of a snapshot that appears in the list of snapshots. However, renaming a snapshot does not change the underlying UUID that was assigned to the snapshot on its creation.

To rename a snapshot, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).
1. Select the organization or project where you created the cluster.
1. Click **Consul**.
1. From the Consul Overview, click the cluster ID where you took the snapshot.
1. Click **Snapshots**.
1. Next to the snapshot you want to rename, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then **Rename**.
1. Enter a new name for the snapshot. Then, click **Rename snapshot**.

## Delete a snapshot

To delete a snapshot, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).
1. Select the organization or project where you created the cluster.
1. Click **Consul**.
1. From the Consul Overview, click the cluster ID where you took the snapshot.
1. Click **Snapshots**.
1. Next to the snapshot you want to delete, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then **Delete**. 
1. Type **DELETE** in the text box to confirm. Then, click **Delete snapshot**.
