# Cluster management

@include 'alerts/consul-dedicated-eol.mdx'

This page explains concepts associated with *HCP Consul Dedicated clusters*.

## Background

You may be familiar with clusters in other contexts, but a *cluster* in Consul refers to the group of Consul servers that participate in a datacenter's Raft quorum. Consul servers are deployed in a cluster with either three or five voting members in a typical production scenario, although single server deployments are possible for testing and development purposes.

For more information about Consul servers and how they work, refer to the following concepts in the [Consul documentation](/consul/docs):

- [Consul architecture](/consul/docs/architecture) describes the overall role Consul servers play in a deployment
- [Consensus protocol](/consul/docs/architecture/consensus) describes how servers elect leaders to product quorums through the Raft protocol
- [Fault tolerance](/consul/docs/architecture/improving-consul-resilience) describes how the number of Consul servers impact network resiliency

## HCP Consul Dedicated clusters

A *HCP Consul Dedicated cluster* is a set of one to three Consul servers that are installed, bootstrapped, and configured by HashiCorp, and hosted in a HCP Consul Dedicated environment. You can create a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster in either an AWS or Azure environment. Because we are responsible for the initial setup process, using HCP Consul Dedicated clusters removes much of the initial operating burden associated with implementing Consul in your service network. We are also responsible for maintaining the hardware and ensuring its availability, freeing up your time and resources for other network operations.

When you use HCP Consul Dedicated clusters, we deploy and maintain the control plane but you are still responsible for operating the data plane. This includes hosting and maintaining your services in your preferred environment, as well as registering them with Consul. To enable communication between HCP Consul Dedicated control plane and services in the data plane, you must create a [HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) and peer your HVN to AWS or Azure. To learn more about the process for each cloud environment, refer to [Create and manage an HVN for AWS](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-aws) or [Create and manage an HVN for Azure](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-azure).

The following diagrams describe the architecture for connections between HCP Consul Dedicated clusters and dataplane components hosted in a user-managed environment:

When deploying a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster, the [cluster tier](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-tiers) and cluster size you select affect the cluster's functionality and the number of service instances it can support.
