# HCP Consul Central

HCP Consul Central was a hosted management plane service available through the HashiCorp Cloud Platform that supported centralized global management operations across Consul clusters. HCP Consul Central was deprecated on November 6, 2024 and is no longer available.

To replace the visibility gained from HCP Consul Central, we recommend the [Grafana observability dashboards in the Consul documentation](/consul/docs/connect/observability/grafanadashboards).

You can still use the Consul UI for cluster-level management, but there are no equivalent tools for global control.

This decision is part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our offerings and enhance our focus on delivering the best possible solutions to our customers.
