# HCP Consul Dedicated cluster overview

@include 'alerts/consul-dedicated-eol.mdx'

This topic provides an overview for using HCP Consul Dedicated server clusters in your Consul deployment.

For more information about HCP Consul Dedicated clusters and how they differ from self-managed Community and Enterprise clusters, refer to [cluster management](/hcp/docs/consul/cluster-management).

## Introduction

Creating a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster simplifies the overall process of bootstrapping Consul servers. The HCP platform automates the following parts of a cluster's lifecycle:

- Generating and distributing a gossip key between servers
- Starting the certificate authority and distributing TLS certificates to servers
- Bootstrapping the ACL system and saving tokens to a secure Vault environment
- Rotating expired TLS certificates after expiration
- Upgrading servers to new versions of Consul

## Workflow

To get started with HCP Consul Dedicated clusters, complete the following tasks in order:

1. Create an HVN and connect it to your cloud environment. This task prepares your network so that you can establish communication between the Consul servers, which are hosted in a HCP Consul Dedicated environment, and your services, which are hosted in a user-managed environment. Refer to [Create and Manage an HVN](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-aws) for more information.
1. [Create an HCP Consul Dedicated cluster](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/create). You can choose between using a guided UI workflow or generating an end-to-end Terraform configuration.
1. Get credentials and URLs to [access the cluster](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/access). HCP generates an admin token that you can use to view the Consul UI or make calls to the Consul HTTP API.
1. Depending on whether you use VMs or Kubernetes, [deploy Consul clients](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/clients) or [deploy Consul dataplanes](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/dataplanes) and register your services with the cluster.
1. Create and apply service intentions to secure communication in the service mesh. For additional guidance, refer to [Create and manage intentions](/consul/docs/connect/intentions/create-manage-intentions) in the Consul documentation.

## Guidance

The following resources are available to help you use HCP Consul Dedicated clusters.

### Concepts and reference

- [Cluster management](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-management) explains the difference between HCP Consul Dedicated clusters and self-managed Community and Enterprise clusters.
- [Cluster tiers](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-tiers) explains how the tier you select when creating a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster determines its multi-cloud functionality.
- [Cluster configuration reference](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/reference) provides reference information about cluster properties, including the [ports HCP Consul Dedicated clusters listen on](/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated/reference#cluster-server-ports).
