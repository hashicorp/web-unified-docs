# HCP Consul Dedicated overview

@include 'alerts/consul-dedicated-eol.mdx'

This topic provides an overview of HCP Consul Dedicated, the networking software as a service (SaaS) product available through the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP). This service provides simplified workflows for common Consul tasks and the option to have HashiCorp set up and manage your Consul servers for you.

<HCPCallout product="consul" />

> **Tutorial:** For a step-by-step guide to deploying a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster, complete the [getting started tutorial](/consul/tutorials/get-started-hcp).

## What Consul services does HCP provide?

**HCP Consul Dedicated clusters:** Support service network deployments with Consul servers that we install, configure, and maintain on either AWS or Azure to ensure that your Consul clusters are always ready to connect your services. Refer to [cluster management](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-management) for more information.

HashiCorp previously offered HCP Consul Central, which was deprecated on November 6, 2024. [Learn more about HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/consul-central).

## Benefits

Consul is a feature-rich and highly-configurable service networking solution. Configuring, deploying, and maintaining Consul infrastructure can seem daunting, especially for new users. HCP Consul Dedicated removes the need for Consul-specific expertise by handling the most complex operations.

The benefits to using HCP Consul Dedicated include the following:

- **Secure by default:** HCP Consul Dedicated servers are deployed with a secure policy that requires connections to have explicit permission. In addition to providing secure network connectivity for features such as datacenter federation and cluster peering, we proactively patch any [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=consul) to ensure your Consul servers are protected.
- **Fully-managed infrastructure:** You can expect production-ready servers with guaranteed [service level agreements (SLA)](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sla) that are monitored and maintained by HashiCorp site reliability engineers (SRE). We also provide backup and restore options, freeing you to focus on using Consul and its capabilities.
- **Push button deployments:** You can use the HCP interface to spin up Consul servers. The interface includes both a guided UI and Terraform automation options for quickly creating new clusters.

## Features

Feature availability for multi-region and multi-cloud networks is based on the tier you use for your Consul clusters.

Cluster size and tier have no impact on the availability of Enterprise features. Most Consul Enterprise features are available to HCP Consul Dedicated clusters as soon as you create them. For more information, including Enterprise license configuration and retrieval, refer to [Consul Enterprise](/consul/docs/enterprise) in the Consul documentation.

### Cluster size and tier

When you create a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster, you are prompted to select a size and a tier for it. This choice determines the number of service instances the cluster can support and the level of multi-region and multi-cloud connectivity the cluster supports, respectively. You cannot change a cluster's tier after its creation.

Refer to [cluster tiers](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-tiers) for more information about the cluster sizes and connections each tier supports. For more information about tier compatability across networks, refer to [network topologies](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/network-topologies).

The cost of using HCP Consul Dedicated is calculated according to the number of clusters your organization deploys, with larger size clusters and higher level tiers incurring higher charges over time. Refer to [HCP Consul Dedicated Pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/pricing?ajs_aid=f6bd8009-4bf9-4ea1-a9eb-011771b6da41&product_intent=consul&utm_source=docs) for more information.

## Workflows

Using HCP Consul Dedicated consists of the following workflow phases:

- [Deploy a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster](/hcp/docs/consul/hcp-managed). Create a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster, connect it to services deployed in your environment, and access the cluster through its CLI, API, or Consul UI.
- [Secure your network](/hcp/docs/consul/secure). Change a HCP Consul Dedicated cluster's accessibility or create service intentions to secure service mesh traffic.
- [Extend your network](/hcp/docs/consul/extend/cluster-peering). Create WAN-federated clusters or create cluster peering connections so that services deployed to different regions can communicate. Build multi-cloud deployments with cluster peering.
- [Monitor your network](/hcp/docs/consul/monitor). Access a HCP Consul Dedicated server's audit logs, platform logs, and server logs.
- [Upgrade your network](/hcp/docs/consul/upgrade). Check the version of Consul currently running on clusters and upgrade them using the HCP interface. Create and manage snapshots to restore clusters in the event of failure.

## Constraints and considerations

The following constraints may cause HCP Consul Dedicated to function inconsistently:

- HVN peering connections with a VPC or VNet support RFC1918 IP addresses only.
- The Consul `monitor` command is not supported on HCP Consul Dedicated.
- You cannot use WAN federation and multiple admin partitions at the same time.
- You cannot use WAN federation and cluster peering at the same time.
- HCP Consul Dedicated does not support AWS Certificate Manager as a certificate authority for your service mesh.
- You may experience issues connecting HCP Consul Dedicated v1.11.0 clusters to Consul Enterprise clients versions 1.10.0-1.10.6. If you want to connect to HCP Consul Dedicated v1.11.2 or later, we recommend using Consul Enterprise v1.10.7 for your clients. This issue is only applicable to Consul Enterprise binaries.
