**AWS Transit Gateway Attachments:** As you grow your HCP footprint, you’ll need more elegant ways to simplify networking at scale. That’s why we introduced support for transit gateway attachments in HCP. Transit gateways enable a “hub-and-spoke” configuration of your networks, a simpler and more secure option compared to the complexity of managing separate virtual private cloud (VPC) connections. Instead of establishing a VPC peering connection for every environment, you can create an “attachment” to a transit gateway. The transit gateway then manages these connections centrally. With a transit gateway, you can secure a single ingress/egress point, instead of monitoring multiple peering connections. To get started, [read this tutorial](/hcp/tutorials/networking/amazon-transit-gateway) and [watch webinar](https://www.hashicorp.com/events/webinars/connecting-hcp-consul-with-aws-transit-gateways).

**HVN Routes (Web Portal Only):** Users now have a single place to view/edit all of the connections associated with HVN’s. This includes the option for the user to view routes for BOTH peerings and TGW attachments. There are options to view/add/delete HVN routes through the UI.

**Single Sign-On via Okta:** HCP allows organizations to configure SAML 2.0 SSO (Single Sign-On) as an alternative to traditional user management with GitHub and email-based options. This can help mitigate Account Take Over (ATO) attacks, provide a universal source of truth to federate identities from your identity provider (IDP), and better manage user access to your organization. At this time, HCP integrates with Okta as an identity provider, with others planned. [Read more](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/sso)
