# Ignore rules

You can configure to skip detected risks based on various parameters. To do
that, create a yaml file, see the example below, and put it into path where
Vault Radar will be able to find. 

## Where to create the file

Create a `$HOME/.hashicorp/vault-radar/ignore.yaml` file or relative to your working repository root `.hashicorp/vault-radar/ignore.yaml`.

### Example

```yaml
# Ignore by file path
- paths:
    - "**/*_test.go"
    - cli/cmd/default-nil-config.yaml
    - cli/cmd/data/*

# Ignore by secret value
# Equivalent to 'secret_value == my_password OR secret_value == my_token'
- secret_values:
    - my_password
    - my_token

# Ignore by secret type
# Equivalent to 'secret_type == password_assignment OR secret_type == secret_assignment'
- secret_types: [password_assignment, secret_assignment]
```

### Field descriptions

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `paths`         | To skip risks found in particular **files**, add the rule to `paths` section. Each entry can be a concrete file path or a glob mask.                    |
| `secret_values` | To skip particular **values**, add the rule to `secret_values` section. Each entry is a regex, if the risk value matches the regex, it will be ignored. |
| `secret_types`  | To skip particular **types**, add the rule to `secret_types` section. You enter the secret type value in all lower case. For a full list of all event types, refer to the Event rules in the Settings section of the HCP Portal. |
