# Combine multiple scan results

It might be useful to create a single file with results from multiple different
scans. The combined file can be used to look at all scan results in a single
view, or can be passed to other commands as well. 

How to combine the results depends on the format of the resulted file. 

## JSON

If the output file format is JSON, combining multiple results is simple. As the
format is a json-lines, each line is completely independent, and you can
concatenate all the result files:

```shell-session
$ cat results-1.jsonl results-2.jsonl > combined-results.jsonl
```

#### Example 

Scan two different vault clusters and create a combined index. See
[index vault](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/index/vault#index-generation) for
information about creating an index.

1. Scan a Vault cluster and store the result in `vault-index-1.jsonl`.

  ```shell-session
  $ VAULT_ADDR=[ADDR1] VAULT_TOKEN=[TOKEN1] vault-radar index vault \
      -o vault-index-1.jsonl --index
  ```

1. Scan another Vault cluster and store the result in `vault-index-2.jsonl`.

  ```shell-session
  $ VAULT_ADDR=[ADDR2] VAULT_TOKEN=[TOKEN2] vault-radar index vault \
      -o vault-index-2.jsonl --index
  ```

1. Combine the two scan results.

  ```shell-session
  $ cat vault-index-1.jsonl vault-index-2.jsonl > combined-vault-index.jsonl
  ```

## CSV

Each CSV file has a header line, so just combining files will not properly work.
To combine a combination of `head` and `tail` commands can be used.

```shell-session
$ head -n 1 result-1.csv > combined-results.csv && \
    tail -n+2 -q results-1.csv results-2.csv >> combined-results.csv
```

#### Example

Scan two git repositories and create a combined file.

1. Scan a git repository and store the result in `scan-repo-results-1.csv`.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault-radar scan repo -u <REPO-URL-1> -o scan-repo-results-1.csv
  ```

1. Scan another git repository and store the result in
   `scan-repo-results-12.csv`.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault-radar scan repo -u <REPO-URL-2> -o scan-repo-results-2.csv
  ```

1. Combine the two scan results.

  ```shell-session
  $ head -n 1 scan-repo-results-1.csv > combined-results.csv && \
      tail -n+2 -q scan-repo-results-1.csv scan-repo-results-2.csv >> combined-results.csv
  ```

<Note>

As a best practice, combine CSV results form the same command. For example,
combine the returned results from the `scan repo` command. Combining results
from different commands, (e.g. `scan repo` and `scan folder`) will not properly
work as different commands have different columns.
