# HCP upload

For commands that HCP upload is enabled, you will need to configure
your environment to complete the upload process.

## Create service principals

Log into the HCP web portal and follow the [Project service
principals documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal#project-level-service-principals-1)
to create a service principal.

Service principals require the `Vault Radar CLI User` role in the `Vault Radar` service. Refer to the [HCP
IAM documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users#project-role) for more information
on HCP roles.

Service principal credentials should not be shared.

<Note> 

Be sure to securely store the client secret after creation as you will be unable to retrieve
it later.

</Note>

## Prepare your environment

You will need to set the following environment variables for your CLI runtime
referencing the newly created Service Principals.

```shell-session
$ export HCP_PROJECT_ID=<HCP_PROJECT_ID>
$ export HCP_CLIENT_ID=<HCP_CLIENT_ID>
$ export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<HCP_CLIENT_SECRET>
```
