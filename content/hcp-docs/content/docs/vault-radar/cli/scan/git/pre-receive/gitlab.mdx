# GitLab pre-receive hook

The following are required to be uploaded to the server first:
- The vault-radar CLI executable. 
- A [valid Vault Radar license](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/scan/git/pre-receive/overview#Prerequisites).
- A [config file](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/scan/git/pre-receive/overview#Configuration).
- A hook script.

Depending on the GitLab version and how the server is deployed there can be many ways to do this. [See GitLab's documentation for more information.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/server_hooks.html)
