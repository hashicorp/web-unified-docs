The `scan docker-image` command is used for scanning a Docker image.

<Note title="Docker version">

This command only works with Docker Engine version 24.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Usage: vault-radar scan docker-image [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Scanning a docker image

Scan a public docker image (or a private image that is already pulled/dowloaded
locally) and write the results to a file in CSV format, this is the default
format for output. 

Image reference may optionally include a tag. We will scan the latest tag if no
tag is specified.

[Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is a pre-requisite for
scanning docker images using vault-radar. Docker version 24.x is required.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan docker-image -i <IMAGE REFERENCE> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning a private docker image

To scan a private docker image, specify the following environment variables to
authenticate against the registry:

1. `DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME`
1. `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan docker-image -i <IMAGE REFERENCE> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

**Example:**

First, set the username and password as an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<ARTIFICATORY_USERNAME>
$ export DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN>
```

Scan `XXX.artifactory.XXX/YYY-image` image.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan docker-image -i XXX.artifactory.XXX/YYY-image \
    -o results-docker-image.csv
```

### Scanning a docker image and output in JSON

Scan a docker image and write the results to a file in [JSON
Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format.  

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan docker-image -i <IMAGE REFERENCE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.jsonl \
    -f json
```

### HCP connection scanning behavior
The scan commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Scanning using a Vault index file

Perform a scan using a generated Vault index and write the results to an output
file. In this mode, if a risk was previously found in Vault, the scan results
will report the location in Vault as well.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan docker-image -i <IMAGE REFERENCE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --index-file <PATH TO VAULT INDEX>.jsonl
```

### Scan and restrict the number of secrets found

Scan a docker image and write the results to an output file and stop scanning
when the defined number of secrets are found.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan docker-image -i <IMAGE REFERENCE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    -l <NUM OF SECRETS>
```
