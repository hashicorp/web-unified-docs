# Vault Radar MCP server overview

The Vault Radar model context protocol (MCP) server helps improve agentic
workflows related to Vault Radar. The server requests information directly from
the HCP platform so that your model can formulate intelligent responses.

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

## Introduction

MCP standardizes how AI models can discover and interact with external tools,
applications, and data sources. You can configure MCP clients, such as an AI or
LLM chat, to send requests through an MCP server. The model can then give
answers to prompts that it may not be trained on. Refer to the [MCP
documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for details about
how MCP works. 

You can configure your AI model to connect to the Vault Radar MCP server so that
it can request information about data sources, resources, and found events from
the HCP Vault Radar APIs.

## Workflow

- [Deploy the Vault Radar MCP server](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/mcp-server/deploy)
- [Prompt your model](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/mcp-server/prompt)

## Vault Radar MCP server tools

The Vault Radar MCP server runs as a container on your local workstation and
exposes functionality to your clients. The Vault Radar MCP server
includes a set of tools that retrieve different types of information from your
project's HCP Vault Radar instance:

- `query_vault_radar_data_sources`: Queries all data sources available in the Vault Radar project.
- `query_vault_radar_resources`: Queries all resources in your HCP Vault Radar project.
- `query_vault_radar_events`: Queries all the events in your HCP Vault Radar project.
- `list_vault_radar_secret_types`: Lists the detected secret types in your HCP Vault Radar project.

## Changelog

See the [changelog](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/mcp-server/changelog) for the Vault Radar MCP server to keep track of changes and updates.

## Next steps

[Deploy the Vault Radar MCP server](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/mcp-server/deploy) and
integrate it with your local AI client.
