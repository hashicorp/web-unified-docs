# Deploy the Vault Radar MCP server

Deploy the Vault Radar model context protocol (MCP) server in a Docker container
on your local workstation. The Vault Radar MCP server connects to a client so
that your LLM can use the data from your HCP Vault Radar instance to answer
questions. Refer to the [overview](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/mcp-server/overview)
for additional information about the Vault Radar MCP server.

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

## Overview

Complete the following steps to deploy the Vault Radar MCP server:

1. Pull the Docker image 
1. Connect your client to the MCP server
1. Configure your client

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine v20.10.21+ or Docker Desktop v4.14.0+

### Clients 

The Vault Radar MCP server supports the following clients:

- [VS Code with Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)
- [Anthropic Claude desktop](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-for-desktop)

### Authentication

The MCP server requires authentication to access HCP Vault Radar APIs. Create a
service principal for your HCP project with viewer role and create service
principal keys. 

- [Create a service principal](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal#create-a-service-principal)
- [Generate a service principal key](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/key#generate-a-service-principal-key)

## Enable MCP in your client

Refer to your client's documentation for instructions on enabling MCP:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers)
- [Anthropic Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

## Install the server

The Vault Radar MCP server is available as a Docker image. You can pull the
image from the Docker Hub repository. Or you can [download the binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-radar-mcp-server) and run the server manually.

Create an `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` or `.cursor` directory of your local
workspace and add the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "vault-radar": {
                "command": "docker",
                "args": [
                    "run",
                    "--rm",
                    "-i",
                    "-e", "HCP_PROJECT_ID=<HCP Project ID>",
                    "-e", "HCP_CLIENT_ID=<HCP Service Principal Client ID>",
                    "-e", "HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<HCP Service Principal Client Secret>",
                    "hashicorp/vault-radar-mcp-server:<tag>",
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can configure an MCP server for all the workspaces by updating user settings
and adding the following configuration to your settings.json file:

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "vault-radar": {
                "command": "docker",
                "args": [
                    "run",
                    "--rm",
                    "-i",
                    "-e", "HCP_PROJECT_ID=<HCP Project ID>",
                    "-e", "HCP_CLIENT_ID=<HCP Service Principal Client ID>",
                    "-e", "HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<HCP Service Principal Client Secret>",
                    "hashicorp/vault-radar-mcp-server:<tag>",
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
