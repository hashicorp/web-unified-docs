# Security considerations for the Vault Radar MCP server

Integrating security workflows with agentic AI tools requires careful
consideration of the security model for the Vault Radar MCP server.

Learn more about the HCP Vault Radar [security
model](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/security-model) for information about how Vault Radar
protects your secrets and sensitive information.

## Overview

HCP Vault Radar scans supported data sources for leaked secrets and sensitive
information. 

## Data storage

The Vault Radar service does not store any discovered secrets. Because Vault
Radar does not store secrets, it is impossible for secrets to leak through
Vault Radar, or its supported tools like the Vault Radar CLI or the Vault Radar
MCP server.

The Vault Radar MCP server operates in a stateless manner, meaning it does not
persist any data between requests. It processes each request independently, and
formats the response for the target large language model (LLM).

## Authentication

### HCP Vault Radar API authentication

The Vault Radar MCP server connects to a subset of the Vault Radar API's using a
project level service principal with the viewer role.

By using the viewer role, there is no risk of changing the Vault Radar
configuration.

### MCP server authentication

The Vault Radar MCP server operates as a standalone service, utilizing the
MCP [standard input/output (STDIO)
transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio).

This allows AI tools to connect to the MCP server only within the context of the
local environment, mitigating common attack vectors such as token pass-through or
session hijacking.
