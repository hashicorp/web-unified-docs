# Create custom expressions

Vault Radar custom expressions allows you to receive events when the regular
expressions defined by you match monitored resources. The chosen description
also appears in the events list. In general, custom expressions allow you to
define new secret types, PII information, or non-inclusive language.

<Note>

Vault Radar supports the Go Programming Language and PCRE formats for regular expressions.

You can also edit or delete a defined custom expression. The updated custom
expressions do not affect earlier scan results but affect future scans.
When you run a reconciliation scan, on-demand scan, PR webhook scan, or similar,
you can view events based on the updated regular expression pattern.
