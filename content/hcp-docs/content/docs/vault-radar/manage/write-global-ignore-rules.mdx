# Write global ignore rules

Vault Radar ignore rules allow you to ignore certain events based on a set
of rules. You can create ignore rules for a path, file, or secret
type. Vault Radar applies rules across all data sources, or specific data sources.

All ignore rules support regular expressions (regex). This allows you add regex
to match different types of events in a single ignore rule.

## Ignore rule behavior

When you add a ignore rule, Vault Radar still generates an event
when it finds sensitive data during a scan. Any event that matches an ignore
rule will have:

1. Severity set to **INFO**.
1. An **Ignore rule** flag added.
1. State set to **Not important**.

## Set global ignore rules

1. Select **Settings/Global Ignore Rules**.

1. Enter the Ignore rules as YAML and update.

  ![Global Ignore Rules](/img/docs/vault-radar/global-ignore-rules.png)

  Types of global ignore rules you can write:

    - [Path ignore rules](#path-ignore-rules)
    - [Secret ignore rules](#secret-ignore-rules)
    - [Secret type ignore rules](#secret-type-ignore-rules)
    - [Resource ignore rules](#resource-ignore-rules)

The updated ignore rules do not affect the existing events but will reflect on
events from future scans. The next time you run a reconciliation scan, on-demand
scan, PR webhook scan, or similar, the events will change based on the updated
ignore rules.

## Path ignore rules

Path based ignore rules allow you to ignore entire paths, such as directory used
for documentation, or specific files within a resource.

### Example path ignore rule

Ignore all files in a directory.

```yaml
- paths:
  - docs/*
```

Ignore specific files in a directory.

```yaml
- paths:
  - docs/index.mdx
```

## Secret ignore rules

Secret ignore rules allow you ignore specific secret values used in a data
source, such as a example password used in documentation or as help within the
application.

### Example secret ignore rule

```yaml
- secret_values:
  - WorstPasswordEver
```

## Secret type ignore rules

Secret type ignore rules allow you to ignore built-in event rules expected in a data source.

You enter the secret type value in all lower case. For a full list of all
event types, refer to the **Event rules** in the **Settings** section of the HCP
Portal.

<Note>

Event types in [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) in the format of "Platform type of secret". When
used for a global ignore rule, convert to all lower case and replace any spaces
with underscores ( `_`).

</Note>

### Example secret type ignore rule

```yaml
- secret_types:
  - aws_access_key_id
```

## Resource ignore rules

Resource ignore rules allow you to configure one or more ignore rules on a
specific resource such as a repository, instead of all resources. Ignore
rules are useful on repositories that may generate a
high level of unimportant alerts, but do not want to ignore those events on
other repositories.

### Example resource ignore rule

```yaml
- repo_url: https://example.com/directory/(subdirectoryA|subdirectoryB)
  rules:
    - secret_types:
      - aws_access_key_id
```
