# Select event rules

Vault Radar event rules allow you to customize events' severity based on the
secret type. All built-in events start with the severity level set to **Default
(dynamic)**.

When the severity level is set to dynamic, Vault Radar will determine the severity
based on multiple factors such as whether the secret is found in the latest
version of the code, whether common place holder phrases such as `EXAMPLE` are
included, and the type of file being scanned.

## Edit severities

1. Select **Settings/Event Rules**.

1. Review the available event types, click the **Severity** drop-down, and select the desired severity level.

You can also edit or delete an event rule. The updated event rules do not
affect earlier scan results but affect future scans. When you run a
reconciliation scan, on-demand scan, PR webhook scan, or similar, you can view
events based on the updated severities.
