# HCP Vault Radar extension installation for VS Code

Install the HCP Vault Radar extension for Visual Studio Code from the [Visual Studio

1. Search for `HCP Vault Radar`.

1. Click **Install**.

## Set the license key

Once you install the extension, choose one of the supported options for setting
the license key to begin using the extension.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Key" group="key">

1. When prompted, click **Set license key**.

1. Paste the license key into the window.

1. Press **Enter** on your keyboard.

1. Restart VS Code.

You can also set or change the value of the license key by opening the command
palette and running `> Vault Radar: Set license key`.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="File" group="file">

1. When prompted, click **Set license file**.

1. Browse to the location of the license.

1. Highlight the license file and click **Select license file**.

1. Restart VS Code.

You can also set or change the path to the license file in the settings menu for
the extension, or by opening the command palette and running `> Vault Radar: Set
license file`.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Environment Variable">

Follow the directions for persisting environment variables for your operating
system and preferred shell.

1. Set the `VAULT_RADAR_LICENSE` environment variable to the license key.

   **Example:**

   <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

   ```plaintext
   export VAULT_RADAR_LICENSE="123def...snip...890xyz"
   ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Source the profile for your preferred shell.

   **Example:**

   ```shell-session
   $ source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   You need to perform this step once in the current shell session after
   setting the environment variable.

1. Launch VS Code from your shell.

   ```shell-session
   $ code
   ```

   When you set the license key using an environment variable, you must launch
   VS Code from a shell session to inherit the environment variable.

HashiCorp Vault. You can see if secrets added in your source code are
already stored in Vault.

This integration is optional.

1. Click the HCP Vault Radar icon in the VS Code Activity Bar.

   The extension supports the following auth methods:

   - OIDC

   The associated policies for the selected auth method must include the ability
   to read secrets from the KV v2 secrets engine path entered in the previous step.

   stored in one of the allowed KV v2 secrets engine.

   or open the command palette.
