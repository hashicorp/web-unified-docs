# HCP Vault Radar IDE extension overview

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

Committing secrets to version control is a common mistake that can lead to
security breaches and data leaks. 

Managing, triaging, and remediating [leaked
secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/manage-leaked-secrets)
can be a time-consuming process, and often requires significant manual effort.

HashiCorp's [HCP Vault Radar](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in)
service identifies and helps you remediate leaked secrets from your version
control, or documentation systems.

The HCP Vault Radar IDE extension helps you identify and remove secrets from your
application source code and infrastructure as code files before you commit the secrets to
version control.

After you [install](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/ide/install/vscode) the extension, it
will automatically scan for and highlight secrets when you open or save the file
in your IDE. When supported by the IDE, you will also see alerts in other
information panels, or logs.

When used in conjunction with [HashiCorp Vault](/vault/tutorials/get-started),
you can correlate secrets detected by the plugin with secrets stored in Vault,
or copy secrets not already stored to the Vault cluster. Once you copy secrets
to Vault, you can update the source code to reference the secret rather than
embedding the secret in the source code.
