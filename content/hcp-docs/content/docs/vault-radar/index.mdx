# What is Vault Radar?

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CoZo6ucr00"/>

Vault Radar is a product that automates the detection and identification of
unmanaged secrets in your code so that security teams can take appropriate
actions to remediate issues.

It continuously scans in real-time for the following types of information:

- Secrets
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Non-inclusive language (NIL)

Once the scanning completes, you can view the detected risks in your code by categories and ranks.

## Who is Vault Radar for?

Vault Radar is for development teams and application security (AppSec) teams
of all sizes, as well as enterprise information security (InfoSec) teams.

## How Vault Radar works

Vault Radar scans connected data sources when initially added, when there is a
new commit, and for new pull requests.

## Use cases

Vault Radar identifies risks in code, who has access, and where it goes:

- [Secrets](#secrets)
- [Personally identifiable information (PII)](#personal-identifiable-information)
- [Non-inclusive language (NIL)](#non-inclusive-language)

### Secrets

Passwords, keys, and other secrets in code are no longer secret when someone
shares the code across teams, repositories are public, or when employees leave with copies
of the code.

Vault Radar identifies and helps remove leaked secrets throughout the
development workflow. It scans pull requests, alerts on commits to monitored
repositories, and helps triage and mitigate secrets already committed.

Vault Radar’s deep scans identify secrets in git history, and can even
identify active secrets so you know which ones are most important.

### Personally identifiable information (PII)

Unlike secrets, you can not change or rotate personally identifiable information.
As companies face growing liability for mishandling PII, finding, and excising it
from code is becoming a growing need.

Vault Radar’s deep scans identify PII in git history, show teams the PII
risk across their codebase, and help remediate. Just as with Vault Radar’s
secret detection tools, Vault Radar can block pull requests with PII, and alert teams
any time commits contain PII in monitored repositories.

### Non-inclusive language (NIL)

Companies and open source communities are both increasingly aware of the role
inclusive language plays in attracting and retaining team members in all roles.
Non-inclusive language creates both significant brand risks, as well as
retention risks.

Vault Radar’s tools help identify non-inclusive language throughout the
development process, and guide teams to continuous improvement over time.
