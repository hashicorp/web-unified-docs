# ServiceNow custom fields

Vault Radar integration with ServiceNow supports adding custom fields used to create the tickets.

![Custom fields](/img/docs/vault-radar/integrations/servicenow/custom-fields/servicenow-custom-fields.png)

Supply these key-value pairs to the ServiceNow API. By default Vault Radar is
already sending the following fields:

- `short_description`
- `description`
- `contact_type`
- `category`
- `subcategory`

For a list of potential fields to supply, view the [ServiceNow incident
docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/task/create-an-incident.html).
