# Configure Vault Radar permissions

Vault Radar is initially configured by a user with the HCP IAM admin role.
Any HCP IAM user with the admin role can perform all functions within Vault
Radar. Admins can add a data source, trigger an on-demand scan, view events, and
edit event remediation state.

You must add other HCP IAM user who do not have the HCP admin role to an HCP
IAM group. The group must belong to the project configured with Vault Radar, and
the group assigned one or more data sources.

Vault Radar supports both organization and project level
[users](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users) in [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), and [service
principals](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal) for the Vault Radar
CLI. It is recommend to assign permissions at the project level following the least
privileged access model.

## Add a user for Vault Radar

<Note>

If a user has the HCP IAM admin role, they do not need to be a member other groups to access Vault Radar.

</Note>

1. Find which RBAC role the user will require by referencing the HCP Vault
   Radar permissions in the table below:

    | Vault Radar permissions      | Resource Viwer | Resource Contributor | Viewer | Contributor |  Admin  |
    | :------------------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :---------: | :-----: |
    | View events                      | &#9989; (assigned resources only) | &#9989; (assigned resources only) | &#9989; |   &#9989;   | &#9989; |
    | Edit event remediation state     |         |   &#9989;   |         |   &#9989;   | &#9989; |

    | Add or manage filters            |         |         |         |             | &#9989; |
    | Add or manage event rules        |         |         |         |             | &#9989; |
    | Add or manage custom expressions |         |         |         |             | &#9989; |
    | Add or manage ignore rules       |         |         |         |             | &#9989; |
    | Configure PR checks policies     |         |         |         |             | &#9989; |
    | Trigger on-demand scans          |         |         |         |             | &#9989; |
    | Copy secrets to Vault            |         |   &#9989;   |         |   &#9989;   | &#9989; |

1. Verify or create an HCP IAM group with the desired role.

1. Invite the user from the parent organizations IAM dashboard.

1. When the user accepts the invitation (and if necessary signs up for HCP),
   assign the user a project level HCP IAM role.

1. Add the user to the project with the desired level of access.

Refer to the [Users](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users) page to learn how to invite
users and assign roles.

## Assign resource to resource role groups

The Vault Radar resource roles (viewer and contributor) do not have any permissions by default and you must
have an [HCP IAM Group](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups) created.
A project admin assigns the role to a specific resources in the 
Vault Radar UI. To assign resources to the HCP group:

1. Go to the Vault Radar portal.

1. Select **/Resources**.

1. Select the resources.

    ![Select resource to assign to group](/img/docs/vault-radar/select-resource-group-assignment.png)

1. Click **Assign Groups**.

1. Select the Group.

    ![Select group to assign](/img/docs/vault-radar/resource-group-assignment-select-group.png)

1. Select Viewer or Contributor type.

1. Click **OK**.

    ![View resource to assign to group](/img/docs/vault-radar/view-resource-group-assignment.png)

The user can now access Vault Radar Event page so see the findings assign to their group.

## Remove resources from the resource role groups

To remove a resource to a group.

1. Go to the Vault Radar portal.

1. Select **/Resources**.

1. Click on the resource.

1. Click on the trash icon next to the group name.

    ![Remove resource to assign to group](/img/docs/vault-radar/remove-resource-group-assignment.png)

<Note>

The resource is now removed from that HCP Group and individuals within that group will no longer be able to see it in the Vault Radar Portal.
