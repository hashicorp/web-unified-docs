# Set up alerting

Monitoring events are an important part of your organization's security
posture. HCP Vault Radar allows you to set up two types of monitoring: audit
events, and service events.

## Audit events

The HCP platform creates audit events for actions taken by a
user or service in your HCP organization. Events include authenticating to
HCP, enabling audit log shipping, and other management operations. Enable audit
events for HCP Vault Radar at the HCP organization level.

Refer to the [HCP audit logging documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/audit-log) for
information on enabling audit log streaming and setting up a log destination.

## Service events

The HCP Vault Radar service creates events to notify you of
activity related to your Vault Radar service, such as when a new secret is
detected. Once you enable HCP audit log streaming, no further action is needed
to collect Vault Radar audit events.

Refer to the supported HCP Vault Radar integration targets in this directory for
information on enabling service event log shipping to your log aggregation service.
