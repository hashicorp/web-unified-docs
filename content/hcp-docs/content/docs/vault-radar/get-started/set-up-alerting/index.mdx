# Set up alerting

Receiving alerts for events is an important part of your organization's security
posture. HCP Vault Radar allows you to set up alerts for service related events.

## Service events

The HCP Vault Radar service creates events to notify you of
activity related to your Vault Radar service, such as when Vault Radar detects a
new secret. Service events are distinct from [audit
events](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/get-started/set-up-audit-streaming), and enabled
separately.

Refer to the HCP Vault Radar integration targets for information on
enabling service event log streaming to your log aggregation service.
