# Correlate findings with Vault

<Highlight title="Vault Enterprise Only">

Correlation between HCP Vault Radar and HashiCorp Vault is supported on HCP
Vault Dedicated or Vault Enterprise clusters.

</Highlight>

When the HCP Vault Radar agent connects to a HCP Vault Dedicated or Vault Enterprise cluster, 
Vault Radar can correlate findings with secrets stored in Vault. This allows you to identify 
what secrets you need to rotate.

## Connect a Vault cluster

Before you can correlate findings with Vault, you need to [deploy the Radar
agent](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/agent/deploy). Once you deploy the agent, you can
configured and connect Vault to the agent.

### Create a Vault policy

Vault Radar requires the following capabilities:
- Validate tokens (using self-lookup API)
- List and read all namespaces
- List all auth methods and mounts in each namespace
- List all secrets in a KV secrets engine mount
- Read all the versions of a secret in a KV secret engine mount

A policy granting just the required level of access requires explicitly specifying the namespaces and KV mounts.

```hcl
path "auth/token/lookup-self" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "sys/license/status" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Assumption: Namespaces are atmost 2 levels deep
path "sys/namespaces/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "+/sys/namespaces/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "+/+/sys/namespaces/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "sys/auth" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/sys/auth" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/+/sys/auth" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "sys/mounts" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/sys/mounts" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/+/sys/mounts" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Assumption: KV secret engine mounts are atmost 2 levels deep
path "+/metadata/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "+/+/metadata/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "+/+/+/metadata/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "+/+/+/+/metadata/*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

path "+/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/+/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/+/+/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "+/+/+/+/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

For less restrictive environments, you can give broader permissions to Vault
Radar.

A simple policy that grants Vault Radar broad access to your Vault cluster.

```hcl
path "*" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

### Agent configuration with Vault

Set up and manage a Vault cluster from the Vault Radar module in the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/). Select **Settings**, then **Secret Managers**, and then click **Connect new secret manager**.
