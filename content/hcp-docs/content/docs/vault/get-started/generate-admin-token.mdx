# Generate an admin token

HCP Vault Dedicated clusters operate from the `admin` namespace, unlike a self-managed
Vault Enterprise cluster which operates from the `root` namespace.

The admin token generated from [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) provides administrative access to
the admin namespace. The root namespace is reserved for platform operations and
not customer accessible.

<Highlight title="Recommended practice for Vault administrators">

The admin token generated in [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) should be used for initial
configuration or emergency access only.

You can mitigate the risk of not being able to generate admin tokens during a
platform outage by setting up appropriate authentication within Vault to
generate tokens that provide the necessary administrative access.

Refer to [Authentication method](/vault/tutorials/cloud/vault-auth-method)
documentation for more information on configuring Vault auth methods.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to
   generate an admin token for.

1. Under **Quick actions** click **Generate token**.

1. When the token generation process completes, click **Copy**.

   You can use the admin token to log in to Vault using the Vault CLI or Vault UI.
