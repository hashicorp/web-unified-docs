# Create an HCP Virtual Network

A HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) is a logical representation of a subnet in
AWS that defines a IPv4 CIDR block. The platform uses this CIDR range to
automatically create a virtual private cloud (VPC).

Refer to the [HVN for AWS documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-aws)
for more information.

## Create a HVN for Azure

@include '/hcp-network/create-hvn-azure.mdx'
