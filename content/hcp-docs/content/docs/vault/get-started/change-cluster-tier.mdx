# Change a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster tier

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) automates the deployment and configuration of
all resources needed to run HCP Vault Dedicated on the cloud service provider (CSP)
associated with the HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN).

You can also change the tier (and size) of a cluster as needed with no planned
downtime. This allows you to scale up your cluster from a lower tier to meet
workload demands during peak hours, and scale down the cluster when needed.

<Note>

You can not scale a cluster down to the development tier.

</Note>

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to
   change the tier for.

1. Click **Manage** and select **Edit configuration**.

1. Click the **Cluster Tier** pulldown menu and select the desired tier.

1. (**Optional**) If supported by the selected tier, click the **Cluster Size**
   pulldown menu and select the desired cluster size.

1. Click **Next**.

1. Click **Apply changes**.

   The cluster update process will begin. The cluster will remain accessible
   by HCP Vault Dedicated clients during the update.
