# Manage public network access

Newly deployed HCP Vault Dedicated clusters are created with default network settings
depending on the tier of the cluster. For Development tier clusters, public
networking is the default and for all other tiers, private networking is the
default.

To learn more about architecture of this network model, please refer to the [HCP
Data Plane](/hcp/docs/hcp#data-plane) documentation.

The cluster's network settings can be edited any time after a cluster is created
to suit your networking requirements.

## Enable public network access

The public network accessibility option enables a publicly accessible endpoint
where the cluster UI and API can be accessed. You can configure an IP allow list
to limit the source IP range(s) that can connect to the cluster's public
endpoint.

When the public network accessibility option is selected, private networking is
also available and can be accssed by enabling a supported private network
connection such as an AWS transit gateway or Microsoft Azure peering connection.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to enable
   public access for.

1. Click **Cluster networking** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. Under **Cluster accessibility** select **Public**.

1. Click **Save**.

## Manage IP allow list

When public access is enabled, we recommend using the IP allow list to manage
which public IP address can access the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster. The IP allow list is
disabled by default for all new clusters.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to enable
   public access for.

1. Click **Cluster networking** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. Under **Cluster accessibility** toggle the **Allow select IPs only** switch.

   There are two options for managing allowed IP addresses: individually and by
   pasting a comma seaprated value (CSV) list.

1. Under the **Add individually** tab enter an IP address in CIDR notation.

   <Note>

   The IP address must be a valid, routable public IP address.

   </Note>

1. Under the **Paste CSV** tab paste a list of comma separate IP addresses in
   CIDR notation.

1. Click **Save**.

## Disable public network access

When the private network accessibility option is selected, the cluster API can
be only be accssed by enabling a supported private network connection such as an
AWS transit gateway or Microsoft Azure peering connection. The UI can still be
accessed using the HCP Proxy by an HCP IAM user, if enabled.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to enable
   public access for.

1. Click **Cluster networking** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. Under **Cluster accessibility** select **Private**. This will disable public
   network access.

1. Click **Save**.
