# HCP Vault Dedicated inventory reporting

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

Integrating Vault as your secrets management can increase security, and reduce
operational overhead to protect sensitive data. However, it is critical to set
the right permissions to control access to those data.

Vault inventory reporting increases visibility into the secrets Vault manages
through the UI and API. The reporting services use telemetry to collect and
surface data about when secrets and certificates are being accessed, modified,
and destroyed. 

## Create a cluster with inventory reporting

<Note title="Sign up for the beta program">

Before you can enable reporting in your Vault clusters, HashiCorp has to enable
a feature flag for your organization. Fill out the
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cUIq5YnN8LfqT8GyvCKqyz9xekigRu4JbfkuDMrdgKU/edit)
to participate in the beta program.

</Note>

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click **Create cluster** and make your
   cluster selections.

   <Tip>

   Refer to the [create a new HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/create-cluster) page for more details.

   </Tip>

1. Select the **Enable reporting** toggle button.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

Once the cluster is up and running, the [secrets inventory
reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/secrets-inventory) and [certificates inventory
reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/certificates-inventory-reporting) become available
as you add secrets.

## Enable reporting on existing clusters 

To enable reporting on existing clusters, select the **Enable reporting** option
when editing the configuration of an existing cluster. This will scan the Vault
cluster and collect telemetry about current state of Vault to populate the
inventory report. 

<Warning>

Note that this scanning will not work for certificates in the cluster. The
recommendation is to enable reporting for certificates at the outset of
certificates cluster creation. If certificates already exist, enable reporting on
that cluster and allowed to soak for 60 days before beginning to use the
reporting functionality so that it is populated with certificates. 

</Warning>

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click on the cluster you want to enable reporting for.

1. Click on **Manage** and select the **Edit configuration** option from the drop-down menu.

1. On the cluster edit configuration screen, select the **Enable reporting** toggle button.
   ![Edit cluster configuration page with Enable Reporting option at the bottom](/img/docs/vault/ui-secrets-reporting.png)

The [secrets inventory reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/secrets-inventory) and
[certificates inventory
reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/certificates-inventory-reporting) become available
on your cluster.


# Disable reporting on a cluster

Disabling reporting on a cluster is possible by following the steps below.
However it is not recommended that reporting be disabled as the data will be
deleted from our systems. Scanning an existing cluster multiple times will
result in loss of data from the date that reporting was first disabled on the
cluster, and re-enrolling the same cluster will result in 

For security purposes, HashiCorp does not retain data which ahs been deleted and
cannot provide a backup of reporting data once reporting has been disabled.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click on the cluster you want to disable reporting for.

1. Click on **Manage** and select the **Edit configuration** option from the drop-down menu.

1. On the cluster edit configuration screen, select the **Disable reporting** toggle button.
