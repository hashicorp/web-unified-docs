# Certificates inventory reporting

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

<Highlight title="Limitations for beta">

Certificates inventory reporting is available for: 

- ACME, SCEP, EST, CMPv2, and Vault issued certificates
- Root, intermediate and leaf certificates

</Highlight>

Using Vault to manage certificates can increase security, and reduce
operational overhead to protect sensitive data. However, it is critical to set
the right permissions to control access to those data.
  
Vault certificates inventory reporting increases visibility into the
certificates Vault manages through the UI and API. The reporting services use
telemetry to collect and surface data that shows when users access, modify, or
allow certificates to expire.

## Prerequisites

To view the inventory reports, make sure to [enable the reporting on your HCP
Vault Dedicated clusters](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting).


## View certificates inventory report

The admin [role](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/vault-permissions) has access to
certificates and secrets inventory reporting. For non-admin users, you need the
**Report reader** role for **Vault reporting** service in addition to view the
certificates inventory report.

This grants access to certificates reporting as well as secret inventory
reporting, and the ability to use a cluster's saved views but not modify them. 

<Tip>

Refer to the [access management](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management) page to
learn more about assigning IAM roles.

</Tip>

1. In the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), select **Vault Dedicated**.

1. Select **Certificates Inventory**.

   You can filter the data using the saved views. Also, you can order the `Common name` and `Valid until` timestamps in ascending or descending dates.

## Saved views 

Saved views are a combination of filters and fields applied to the certificates
inventory report to return a specific set of data. When you enable reporting on
your cluster, it creates three default saved views:

- Static secrets not accessed in the last 90 days
- Upcoming secret rotations in the next 30 days
- Long‑lived secrets that have not been updated in more than 90 days

You can rearrange those saved views and modify them to your specific
organization's needs. As an administrator, you can edit and modify existing
saved views which are available to any report reader or other admins on the
Vault cluster to use. Project members with the report reader role will be able
to use saved views that admins create but cannot modify them. 

### Create a saved view 

1. Create a saved view by making selections from the **Role**, **Filters** or **Fields** drop-downs.
2. Click on saved view to the right of the **Fields** drop-down.
3. Give your saved view a name which describes the data it is surfacing and a description of how to use that saved view.
4. Click **Save** and your saved view will appear in the carousel in the last position.

### Modify a saved view 

1. Click on the three dots to the right of the saved view title.
2. Select **Rename**, and make edits.
4. Click **Update**.

Rearrange your saved views by clicking on the three dots to the right of the saved view title and selecting Rearrange. Drag and drop the saved views in your preferred order and click save.
