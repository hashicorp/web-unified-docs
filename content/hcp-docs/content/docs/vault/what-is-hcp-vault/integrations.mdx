## Audit log streaming

Audit logs keep a detailed log of all requests to Vault, and their responses.
Because every operation with Vault is an API request/response, the audit log
contains every interaction with the Vault API, including errors.

<Note>

Audit log streaming is not available on Development tier clusters.

</Note>

HCP Vault Dedicated supports streaming audit logs to a variety of destinations. Refer to
the [audit log streaming documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/logs-metrics) for more
details on setting up HCP Vault Dedicated with your supported provider.
