# Configure HCP Vault Dedicated metric streaming to New Relic

For details on metrics scope and interpretation, see the [HCP Vault Dedicated metrics
documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/logs-metrics).

<Note title="Availability">

HCP Vault Dedicated metrics streaming is available for all
production grade clusters. The feature is not available for Development tier
clusters.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

To configure metrics streaming to New Relic, you will need to have:

- A HCP account with Admin or Contributor [role assigned in HCP](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account)
- A production grade HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
- Access to New Relic with permission to retrieve the **Ingest License Key**

   <Note>

   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault Dedicated with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster.

   </Note>

## Enable metrics streaming

1. From the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster **Overview** page, select the **Metrics** view.

1. Click **Enable streaming**.

1. From the **Stream Vault metrics** view, select **New Relic** as the provider and click **Next**.

   <Note>

   At this time, HCP Vault Dedicated only supports metrics streaming to one
   metrics endpoint at a time.

   </Note>
