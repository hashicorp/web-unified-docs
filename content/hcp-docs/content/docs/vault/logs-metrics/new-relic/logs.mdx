   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault Dedicated with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster.
