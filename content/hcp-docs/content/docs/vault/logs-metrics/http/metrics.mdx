# Configure HCP Vault Dedicated metric streaming to generic HTTP sink

For details on metrics scope and interpretation, see the [HCP Vault Dedicated metrics
documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/logs-metrics).

<Note title="Availability">

HCP Vault Dedicated metrics streaming is available for all
production grade clusters. The feature is not available for Development tier
clusters.

</Note>

The generic HTTP sink is an optional metric streaming configuration that can be used when native integrations
are not yet available. It provides support for sending metrics in either JSON or NDJSON formats. Additionally,
you can choose to compress (gzip) metrics, if supported by your telemetry service. The exact configuration
of the generic HTTP sink will depend on your target telemetry service. Not all telemetry services
will support the use of the generic HTTP sink.

Refer to the [HCP Vault Dedicated integrations documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/integrations#metrics-streaming)
for a complete list of natively supported providers.

## Prerequisites

To configure audit logs streaming you will need to have:

- A HCP account with the Admin [role assigned](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management)
- An essentials or standard tier HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

   <Note>

   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault Dedicated with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster.

   </Note>

## Configure target metric service

<Highlight title="Example log aggregation service">

Webhook.site is used for demonstration purposes and will generate a unique URL on first access.

If you are using an existing HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, metrics will be publicly available.

</Highlight>

1. Open a web browser and navigate to https://webhook.site/

1. Make note of the URL generated.

1. Leave this page open. You will return to the site when configuring HCP Vault Dedicated.

## Enable metric streaming

1. Open a new web browser/tab and log in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the **Vault clusters** page.

1. Click the Vault cluster you wish to enable streaming for and click **Metrics**.

1. Click **Enable metric streaming**.

1. From the **Select a provider** view, select **Generic HTTP Sink** as the
   provider and click **Next**.

1. Under **Add provider details**, enter **Your unique URL** from webhook.site in the **URI** field.

1. Click the **Strategy** pull down menu. The generic HTTP sink supports both **Basic** (username and password)
   or **Bearer** (token) authentication.

1. Leave the **Strategy** menu blank - it is not required for webhook.site.

1. Leave the **Headers (Optional)** fields empty. Additional headers can be added to the request as key/value pairs.

1. Under **Compression** select **Disable**. Compression allows you to chose whether to gzip logs sent to the logging service.
   Verify whether your logging service supports gzip log streaming.

1. Click the pulldown menu for **Encoding codec** and select **JSON**. The generic HTTP sink supports both JSON and NDJSON.
   When using JSON, the entire message will be sent as a single JSON array. When using NDJSON, each element is placed on
   a new line and not wrapped in brackets (`[]`).

1. Leave the **Payload prefix** and **Payload suffix** empty. The optional prefix and suffix allows you to add a custom prefix
   and suffix to the message which must be JSON formatted.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Metrics will start to appear after a few minutes, though the process to enable metric streaming in the HCP Portal
   may take up to 20 minutes.

   <Note>

   At this time, HCP Vault Dedicated only supports metric streaming to
   one endpoint at a time.

   </Note>

## Edit the metrics streaming configuration (optional)

To edit a metrics streaming integration, perform the following steps.

1. From the **Metrics** page, click on the **Manage** drop-down, then **Edit
   configuration**.

1. Edit the configuration, then click **Save**.

## Disable metrics streaming (optional)

To disable a metrics streaming integration, from the **Metrics** page, click on
the **Manage** drop-down, then **Disable streaming**.
