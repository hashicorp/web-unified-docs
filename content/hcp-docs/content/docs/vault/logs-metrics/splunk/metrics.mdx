# Configure HCP Vault Dedicated metric streaming to Splunk

For details on metrics scope and interpretation, see the [HCP Vault Dedicated metrics
documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/logs-metrics).

<Note title="Availability">

HCP Vault Dedicated metrics streaming is available for all
production grade clusters. The feature is not available for Development tier
clusters.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

To configure metrics streaming to Splunk, you will need to
have:

- Have access to a paid Splunk Cloud or Enterprise account.

   <Note>

   Splunk Cloud Trial account would not work with HCP Vault Dedicated as its HEC (HTTP Event Collector ) listener is hosted using a self signed certificate that HCP won't trust.

   </Note>

- Your Splunk [HEC](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.2/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) and token.

   <Note>

   HEC endpoint should be created using `events` and not `metrics` index in Splunk.

   </Note>

- A HCP account with Admin or Contributor [role assigned in HCP](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account)
- A production grade HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

   <Note>

   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault Dedicated with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster.

   </Note>

## Enable metrics streaming

1. From the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster **Overview** page, select the **Metrics** view.

1. If you have **not** configured metrics streaming before, click **Enable
   streaming**.

1. From the **Stream Vault metrics** view, select **Splunk** as the provider and click **Next**.

1. Under **Splunk Configuration**, enter your **HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
   Endpoint** URL and event collector **Token**.

1. Click **Save**.

   <Note>

   At this time, HCP Vault Dedicated only supports metrics streaming to one
   metrics endpoint at a time.

   </Note>

1. HashiCorp has created a [sample HCP Vault Dedicated Splunk dashboard
template](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5733/) for metrics visualizations.
Splunk dashboard templates are distributed as Splunk apps. If you prefer to use
the sample dashboard template, follow the Splunk instructions for adding a
Splunk app to your Splunk Enterprise or Cloud environment.
