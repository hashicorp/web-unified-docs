# Secrets inventory reporting

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

<Highlight title="Limitations for beta">

The secrets inventory reporting is available for: 

- A new HCP Vault Dedicated cluster running on Amazon Web Services 
- Key/value secrets engine version 1 and version 2

</Highlight>

Integrating Vault as your secrets management can increase security, and reduce
operational overhead to protect sensitive data. However, it is critical to set
the right permissions to control access to those data.

Vault secrets inventory reporting increases visibility into the secrets Vault
manages through the UI and API. The reporting services use telemetry to collect
and surface data about when secrets are being accessed, modified, and destroyed.
