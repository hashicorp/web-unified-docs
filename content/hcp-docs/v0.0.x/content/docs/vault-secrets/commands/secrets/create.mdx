# secrets create 

Command: `vlt secrets create`

Use the `secrets create` to create a new secret in a target application.

### Examples

Create a secret with a key name, "expiration" with value of "October 2024" to
the `company-card` application.  

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets create --app-name="company-card" expiration="October 2024" 
Successfully created secret with name expiration
```

<Tip>

In the absence of `--app-name` parameter, the command will create secrets under
the currently configured application. You can run the `vlt config` command to
see which application is targeted.
