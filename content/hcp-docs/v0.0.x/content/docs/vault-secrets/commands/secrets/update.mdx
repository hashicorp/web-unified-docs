# secrets update 

Command: `vlt secrets update`

The `secrets update` command updates a secret in the target application.

### Examples

Update the value of the secret named "expiration" with value of "August 2025" in
the `company-card` application.  

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets update --app-name="company-card" expiration="August 2025"
Successfully updated secret with name expiration
```

<Tip>

In the absence of `--app-name` parameter, the command will update secrets under
the currently configured application. You can run the `vlt config` command to
see which application is targeted.

</Tip>


This creates a new version of the secret.

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets get expiration

Name        Value             Latest Version  Created At
expiration  ************MjU=  2               2023-05-22T23:26:04.680Z
```

The **Latest Version** number should be incremented.
