# secrets versions 

Command: `vlt secrets versions`


The `secrets versions` command returns the last 10 versions of secrets for a
given application. 

### Examples

Retrieve available versions of a secret named "expiration" stored under the
"company-card" application.

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets versions --app-name="company-card" expiration
```

<Tip>

If the CLI is already configured to point to the "company-card" application via
`vlt config init`, you can omit the `--app-name` parameter.

</Tip>
