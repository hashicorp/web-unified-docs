# secrets delete 

Command: `vlt secrets delete`

The `secrets delete` command deletes a secret in an application.

### Examples

Delete the secret named "expiration" stored in the "company-card" application.

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets delete --app-name="company-card" expiration
Successfully deleted secret
``` 

<Tip>

If the CLI is already configured to point to the "company-card" application via
`vlt init`, you can omit the `--app-name` parameter.

</Tip>

Try reading the expiration secret.

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets get --app-name="company-card" expiration
```

The secret has been deleted and is no longer accessible.
