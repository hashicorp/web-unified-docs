# run

Command: `vlt run`

The `run` command exposes your application's secrets as environment variables.
It uses the secret's name in all upper case to set the environment variables.
The logs and exit codes from the command are forwarded to the run output.


### Examples

The `run` command runs a process while injecting secrets as an environment
variable.

```shell-session
$ vlt run --command="env"

2023/05/23 15:44:47 [INFO] (child) spawning: env
...snipped...
EXPIRATION=October 2024
```

<Tip>

The command looks up the secrets stored in the application currently configured
with `vlt init`. To point to a different application, project or organization,
use the `--app-name`, `--project` or `--organization` to overwrite the current
settings.
