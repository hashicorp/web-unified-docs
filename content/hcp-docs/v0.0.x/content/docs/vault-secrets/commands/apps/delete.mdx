# apps delete 

Command: `vlt apps delete`

The `apps delete` command deletes an application of a given name. 

<Note>

To delete an application, it must be empty. So, delete all secrets stored under
the application before attempting to delete the application.

</Note>

### Examples

First, delete any secrets. The following command deletes the secret named
"expiration" stored in the "company-card" application.

```shell-session
$ vlt secrets delete --app-name="company-card" expiration
Successfully deleted secret
``` 

Delete an application named "company-card". 

```shell-session
$ vlt apps delete company-card
Successfully deleted app
```

<Tip>

If the application is not empty, the command returns an error: `Error: apps must
be empty prior to deletion`.

</Tip>
