# Activity logs

HCP Vault Secrets provides activity logs to trace all incoming requests to your
application so that you can view who requested access to your secrets stored in
the application.

   project you were in. Choose the target project if it is different.

Using the activity logs, you can learn the following information:

- **Event** - the type of operation
- **Triggered By** - the username and IP address from where the request was sent 
- **Scope** - the scope an operation was executed on. For example, if a new
  application was created, the scope of the event is application.
- **Interface** - the interface used to send the request: UI or API. The CLI
  tool is a wrapper for API; therefore, the requests made by the CLI commands
  appear as API.
- **Timestamp** - the timestamp of the event was triggered

<Note title="Limitation">

Currently, the application deletion events do not appear on the activity
logs.
