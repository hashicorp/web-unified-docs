## Standard tier pricing

There are two billing metrics - <b>Secrets</b> as well as <b>Secret Access API Operations</b>. 

You will be charged based on the total secret hours used, billed at a pro-rata monthly rate of $0.50/secret/month. 

For example, if you have 25 secrets created for the entire month and 25,000 API Operations. 

You will be charged a total of $12.50 (25 secrets x $0.50) + $0.25 (25k ops x $0.10) = <b>$12.75</b> for the month
