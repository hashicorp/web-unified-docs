# ServiceNow custom fields

HCP Vault Radar integration with ServiceNow supports adding custom fields that are used to create the tickets.

![Custom fields](/img/docs/vault-radar/integrations/servicenow/custom-fields/servicenow-custom-fields.png)

These key-value pairs are supplied directly to the ServiceNow API. By default HCP Vault Radar is already sending the following fields:

- short_description
- description
- contact_type
- category
- subcategory

For a list of potential fields to supply, view the [ServiceNow incident docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/task/create-an-incident.html).
