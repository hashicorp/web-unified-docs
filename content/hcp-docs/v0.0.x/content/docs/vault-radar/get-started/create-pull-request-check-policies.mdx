# Pull request check policies

![PR Checks](/img/docs/vault-radar/pr-checks/pr-checks-1.png)


Whatever version of the HCP Vault Radar app for GitHub Checks you choose, it will run for every pull request, and for every new commit to any open pull requests.

The app will alert you to any secrets found in the pull request, including both the tip of the pull request and the history of any commits. The alert includes details on where and what type of secret was found.

By default, the HCP Vault Radar app for GitHub Checks does not block any pull requests. Usage statistics show over 80% of warnings about secrets in PRs are fixed before commit, and the non-blocking workflow is more respectful of developer needs.

## GitHub

<Note>

Personal organizations are not currently supported with the checks workflow.
