# Changelog

Keep track of changes to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

### 2024-02-06

**HCP Vault 1.15.5:** Vault 1.15.5 is now available on HCP. Click [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1155) to learn more about what's new in 1.15.5.

### 2024-01-30

**HCP Packer New Nomenclature:**

- Renaming of Image Buckets to Bucket:
	- The prefix 'Image' has been removed from all the resources. This change simplifies the naming convention and makes it more intuitive for users to identify and manage their resources.
- Renaming of Iteration Resource to Version:
	- The 'Iteration' resource has been renamed to 'Version'. This change better reflects the functionality of the resource and aligns with standard terminology used in version control and software development practices.
- Renaming of Image Resource to Artifact:
	- The 'Image' resource has been renamed to 'Artifact'. This renaming is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance clarity and consistency in our resource naming. 'Artifact' more accurately represents the nature and usage of these resources in the multi-cloud environment. 

Notes:
These changes are part of our commitment to improving user experience and aligning with industry standards.
Version [0.82.0] of the HCP provider for Terraform reflects these changes.
For any questions or concerns, please reach out to our support team.

### 2021-05-17

**AWS Transit Gateway Attachments:** As you grow your HCP footprint, youâll need more elegant ways to simplify networking at scale. Thatâs why we introduced support for transit gateway attachments in HCP. Transit gateways enable a âhub-and-spokeâ configuration of your networks, a simpler and more secure option compared to the complexity of managing separate virtual private cloud (VPC) connections. Instead of establishing a VPC peering connection for every environment, you can create an âattachmentâ to a transit gateway. The transit gateway then manages these connections centrally. With a transit gateway, you can secure a single ingress/egress point, instead of monitoring multiple peering connections. To get started, [read this tutorial](/hcp/tutorials/networking/amazon-transit-gateway) and [watch webinar](https://www.hashicorp.com/events/webinars/connecting-hcp-consul-with-aws-transit-gateways).

**HVN Routes (Web Portal Only):** Users now have a single place to view/edit all of the connections associated with HVNâs. This includes the option for the user to view routes for BOTH peerings and TGW attachments. There are options to view/add/delete HVN routes through the UI. [Read more](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/routes)

### 2021-05-03

**Single Sign-On via Okta:** HCP allows organizations to configure SAML 2.0 SSO (Single Sign-On) as an alternative to traditional user management with GitHub and email-based options. This can help mitigate Account Take Over (ATO) attacks, provide a universal source of truth to federate identities from your identity provider (IDP), and better manage user access to your organization. At this time, HCP integrates with Okta as an identity provider, with others planned. [Read more](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/sso)

### 2021-04-07
