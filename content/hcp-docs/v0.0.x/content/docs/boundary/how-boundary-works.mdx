# How HCP Boundary Works
HCP Boundary is an intelligent proxy that automates user and host onboarding, and provisions access permissions. Boundary creates a workflow for
accessing infrastructure remotely with a number of key steps:
* **User Authentication:** Integrates with trusted identity platforms (such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, Ping,
[and many others that support OpenID Connect](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth)).
* **Granular User Authorization:** allows operators to tightly control access to remote systems and the actions that can be performed against those systems.
* **Automated Connections to Hosts:** HCP Boundary streamlines connection to hosts by automating service discovery and access configuration as workloads are
deployed or changed. Dynamic host catalogs are currently available with
[AWS](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/aws-host-catalogs) and
[Azure](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/azure-host-catalogs). This is critical in ephemeral, cloud-based environments
so that operators don't need to reconfigure access lists.
* **Integrated Credential Management:** HCP Boundary brokers access to target credentials natively or via integration with
[HashiCorp Vault](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oss-vault-cred-brokering-quickstart).
* **Time-Limited Network Access to Targets:** Boundary provides time-limited proxies to private endpoints, avoiding the need to expose your network to users.
* **Session Monitoring and Management:** Provides visibility into the sessions Boundary creates.



## Access Model
Across clouds, local data centers, and low-trust networks, HCP Boundary provides a solution to protect and safeguard access to applications and critical systems
by leveraging trusted identities, without exposing the underlying network. HCP Boundary is an identity-aware proxy that sits between users and the infrastructure
they wish to connect.

The proxy has two components:

* **Controllers:** manage state for users, hosts, and access policies, and the external providers HCP Boundary can query for service discovery.
* **Worker:** nodes are assigned by the control plane once an authenticated user selects a host to connect to. Workers are a stateless proxy with end-network access
to hosts under management.

The session is presented to the user as a TCP tunnel wrapped in mutual TLS. This mitigates the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack. If a user is connecting to a
host over SSH through an HCP Boundary tunnel, there are two layers of encryption- the SSH session that user creates, and the underlying TLS that HCP Boundary creates.

## Deployment Options
HCP Boundary is fully managed by HashiCorp, but organizations can choose to self-manage Boundary workers (Boundary's gateway nodes). Self-managed workers enable
organizations to proxy all session data through their own network, while still providing the convenience of a managed service. In the standard fully-managed
deployment model, both the control plane and worker nodes are managed by HashiCorp, making it easy to get started with Boundary while facilitating scaling over time.

**Self-Managed Workers**

Self-managed workers allow Boundary users to securely connect to private endpoints without exposing an organization's networks to the public, or to HashiCorp-managed
resources. All session activity is proxied by the organization's worker nodes. To learn more about self-managed workers see the
self-managed workers [tutorial](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers) and
[operations document](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers).
