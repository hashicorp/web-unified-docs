# Security Model

This document explains the security model of HCP Boundary and the security
controls available to end users. Additionally, it provides best practices for
HCP Boundary-specific features such as self-managed workers, identity
integration with HCP, and describes the multi-tenant architecture and
mitigations to address known threats.

-> **NOTE:** Boundary and HCP Boundary are still under active development, and the security model content will be updated over time.

concepts can be found in the [Boundary’s
documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts).

## Personas

- **SRE Operators:** Site reliability engineers and infrastructure operators
  charged with deploying Boundary and managing the availability of the service.
  In HCP Boundary, operators are HashiCorp employees. 

- **Administrators:** Security administrators, or “admins”, are responsible for
  defining and enabling their organization’s digital security posture. They
  define access policies to critical targets and prove compliance. These admins
  may already be administrators in their HCP organization and  expect to have
  default permissions in Boundary without needing to reconfigure a
  Boundary-specific user profile.

- **Users:** Human users that need to connect to infrastructure targets, but
  typically do so outside of programmatic interfaces. For HCP Boundary GA, this
  is emphatically a technical user and not a standard corporate/business user.
  This will primarily be personas that require infrastructure access, such as
  systems administrators, IT admins, database analysts, developers, and devops
  engineers. End-users may not have an HCP identity profile prior to deployment
  of HCP Boundary.

- **Anonymous or unauthenticated users:** Human users who can reach available
  auth methods and use the auth method to attempt login to Boundary. This user
  can list scopes, but cannot read them.

## High-level Architecture

HCP Boundary is deployed onto a single AWS region across three availability
zones in that region. Each customer cluster is deployed as a Nomad job of Docker
containers. The Nomad jobs are controlled by an external service that accesses
the Nomad cluster through the VPC’s PrivateLink.

### Public-facing URLs

For a given HCP Boundary cluster, the only user-accessible endpoints are the
controllers, which have a randomly-generated, 32-character cluster UUID (e.g.,
`https://<cluster_id>.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`). These machine-generated URLs
provide no discernable patterns, guarding against enumeration of controllers.

## Storage

Boundary controller and worker infrastructure is stateless, whereby all state
lives in the RDBMS. Each Boundary cluster is provided with a separate database
inside of an Aurora Postgres cluster. Access to the database is provided by the
[Vault database engine](/vault/docs/secrets/databases) and
with dynamic credentials that are regularly rotated.

### Tenancy Model

HCP Boundary uses a multi-tenant RDS Postgres cluster with a separate database
per tenant. This architecture allows us to use security controls inherent to
Postgres's database isolation. All secret and sensitive row data is encrypted
with scope specific per-tenant keys (more information in the
[Data Encryption](#data-encryption) section). This is commonly
[referred](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/multi-tenant-data-isolation-with-postgresql-row-level-security/)
to as a _Siloed_ multi-tenant database, as opposed to _Bridging_ or _Pooling_. A
silo model allows us to maintain the strictest security while simplifying the
architecture. 

### Data Encryption

HCP Boundary clusters use the [Vault Transit secrets
engine](/vault/docs/secrets/transit) for their KMS keys
(root, recovery, worker-auth). Boundary controllers are provided access to the
Vault transit keys with a token that is assigned a policy that allows them to
access only their individual keys. These tokens are regularly rotated.

Administrators may also use an external Key Management System, including Vault
and HCP Vault, to manage the key-encrypting (root) key. More information about
supported external KMS systems is available at the [Boundary documentation
page](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms).


## Self-Managed Worker

Self-managed workers are workers that are managed by
administrators outside of HCP infrastructure, in their cloud or on-premise
environment. Just like all Boundary worker-to-controller and client-to-worker
communication, self-managed workers connect to the controller and clients
over mutually-authenticated TLS. More information about authentication of
self-managed workers to the HCP Boundary controller can be found at the
[Boundary documentation
page](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/connections-tls#worker-led-pki-based-registration).

!> **Caution:** A compromised worker may result in the compromise of the targets
assigned to this worker, as well as the integrity of the log data provided by
the compromised worker.

## Data in Transit

![High-level diagram of Boundary](/img/docs/boundary/data-in-transit.png)

### Boundary Session Traffic

All User-to-Controller communications are done over TLS. TLS configuration
options are available at the [Boundary documentation
page](/boundary/docs/configuration/listener/tcp#tls). All
other communication (worker-to-controller and client-to-worker are done over
mutually-authenticated TLS). These keys are automatically generated and managed
by Boundary. More information about the use of TLS in Boundary, refer to the
[TLS in
Boundary](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/connections-tls#tls-in-boundary)
documentation.

## Identity

### HashiCorp Cloud Platform 

The HCP Platform allows administrators to perform high-level cluster lifecycle
operations such as cluster creation and deletion. HCP users and their
permissions can be managed through the HCP Portal. 

![IAM navigation](/img/docs/iam-nav.png)

-> **NOTE:** Once an HCP Boundary cluster is created, [Boundary users and
permissions](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-users-groups)
are managed directly within Boundary itself.

### Boundary

Boundary provides its own identity multiple authentication methods (auth
methods) as well as a fine-grained RBAC model:

- Users are authenticated to Boundary Controllers using a Boundary-configured
  [authentication
  method](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods).
- [Boundary’s permission
  model](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions)
  provides administrators the ability to granularly define role-based access
  control to Boundary’s resources, including explicitly assigning permissions to
  anonymous users.
- Authentication and authorization of all internal Boundary traffic is managed
  using mutually-authenticated TLS as described in the [TLS in
  Boundary](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/connections-tls)
  documentation.

### Cluster Creation

When an HCP cluster tenant is created by an Organization’s administrator, they
will be prompted to create administrative credentials to bootstrap the cluster.
They may then use Boundary-specific authentication methods to connect directly
to the controller and perform administrative tasks.

## Audit

Boundary provides the ability to log all events. More information about the
supported log sinks is available in the [events configuration
documentation](/boundary/docs/configuration/events).
HCP Boundary logs can be sent to [external log ingestion systems](/hcp/docs/boundary/audit-logging).
