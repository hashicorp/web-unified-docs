# Maintenance windows

HCP Boundary automatically updates your environment when a newer version of Boundary is released.
You can alternatively schedule maintenance windows for updates to ensure that your end users' productivity is not disrupted during peak hours.
If you schedule a maintenance window, HCP Boundary waits until the day and time window you selected to apply any patch or major version updates.

1. Log in to the HCP portal, and navigate to the Boundary **Overview** page.
1. Click the options menu next to the Boundary cluster you want to schedule a maintenance window for, and then select **Edit Configuration**.

1. On the **Maintenance window** dialog, select between the two options to control when your cluster is updated:
   - **Automatic** updates the cluster automatically wnen a new version of Boundary is released for HCP.
   - **Scheduled** allows you to select a day and time window for the update to occur. Note that times are listed in UTC.
