# Create and manage add-on definitions

This page describes how to create, edit, and delete HCP Waypoint add-on definitions. Platform engineers often perform these tasks. Refer to [Add-ons](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/add-ons) for additional information.

## Overview

The following steps describe the procedure for creating add-on definitions:

1. For each add-on you want to create, define a no-code module in Terraform Cloud that specifies a common infrastructure pattern. 
1. Use the HCP Waypoint UI to create the add-on.

After creating an add-on, application developers can begin installing it to add additional capabilities to their applications.  

## Prerequisites

- An HCP account with HCP Waypoint enabled. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.
- A Terraform Cloud organization with **Plus tier**. Terraform Cloud must be Plus tier to use Terraform Cloud no-code modules and the private module registry.

## Create a no-code module

To create an add-on definition, you first need to create a no-code module that captures the common infrastructure pattern. Refer to [Designing No-Code Ready Modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design) for instructions on how to create no-code modules.

You can reference the following variables in the module as HCP Waypoint defines the values when the application developer uses the add-on.

- `waypoint_add_on`: References the name of the add-on.
- `waypoint_add_on_definition`: References the name of the add-on definition used to create the add-on.
- `waypoint_application`: References the name of the application for which the add-on is being installed onto by the app developer.

Refer to [Input Variables](/terraform/language/values/variables) for instructions on how to define variables in Terraform.

You may need to create global variable sets within your Terraform Cloud organization so your no-code modules can authenticate and interact with your cloud provider. 

You can use the variable to label infrastructure resources in the no-code module so you can associate them with the HCP Waypoint application.

## Create an add-on definition

After creating the no-code module, complete the following steps in the HCP Waypoint UI:

1. From the HCP Waypoint overview, go to the **Add-ons** menu.
1. Click **Create Add-on**.
1. Specify a unique identifier for the add-on definition in the **Name** field. The name can be up to 24 characters.
1. Specify arbitrary metadata as tags to associate with your add-on definition in the **Tags** field.
1. Add a short description for the definition in the **Short Summary** field. This field can be up to 110 characters. HCP Waypoint presents the description when users install an add-on.
1. Add a full-length description of the definition in the **Full Summary** field. This field can be up to 500 characters. HCP Waypoint presents the description when users install an add-on.
1. Specify instructions for application developers on how to use the template in the **Developer instructions** field. HCP Waypoint exposes the following variables so you can reference them in the developer instructions. This field supports Markdown.
    - `{{ .ApplicationName }}`: Populates the name of the developer's application.
    - `{{ .TfcOrgName }}`: Populates the name of the Terraform Cloud organization.
    - `{{ .AddOnName }}`: Populates the name of the add-on.
1. Choose a no-code module to use as the source for the template from the **Terraform no-code module** drop-down menu. Once you select a no-code module, specify the version HCP Waypoint should reference in the **Terraform Cloud module version** field. No-code modules published in your organization's private registry appear in the menu. 
1. Click **Publish**.

## Edit an add-on definition

Modifying an add-on does not affect existing installations or supporting infrastructure created by the add-on. These changes only apply to new add-on installations.

To edit an add-on definition, complete the following steps:

1. In the HCP Waypoint UI, go to the **Add-ons** menu.
1. Click on the add-on definition you want to modify.
1. Update the desired fields.
1. Click **Save**.

## Delete an add-on definition

Deleting an add-on does not delete the supporting infrastructure that was created with Terraform by the add-on. To do so, you must uninstall the add-on from a application or delete the Terraform resources and the Terraform Cloud workspace associated with the HCP Waypoint add-on. Refer to [Destruction and Deletion](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/deletion) for instructions.

To delete an add-on definition, complete the following steps:

1. From the HCP Waypoint overview, go to the **Templates** menu.
1. Select the add-on definition you want to delete.
1. Click **Delete Add-on**.
1. Enter the name of the Add-on definition and click **Delete**.
