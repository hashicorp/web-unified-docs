# Role-based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) lets you restrict access to specific functionality based on a user's role. In HCP Waypoint, RBAC allows platform engineers to manage templates and add-ons, and allows developers to use them to create applications and install add-ons.

## Permission mappings

HCP Waypoint maps permissions to the admin, contributor, and viewer [HCP roles](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#user-permissions).

Based on the permission associated with each role, we recommend you assign platform engineers the admin role and application developers the contributor role.

|Permission|Admin|Contributor|Viewer|
|---|---|---|---|
|Create template|&#9989;|&#10060;|&#10060;|
|Create application from template|&#9989;|&#9989;|&#10060;|
|View list of applications|&#9989;|&#9989;|&#9989;|
|Create add-on definition|&#9989;|&#10060;|&#10060;|
|Install add-on to application|&#9989;|&#9989;|&#10060;|
|View list of add-ons|&#9989;|&#9989;|&#9989;|

## Assigning roles to users

Refer to the [Manage users section of the HCP Users page](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#manage-users) for details and instructions on how to complete this process.
