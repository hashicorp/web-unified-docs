# Configure Terraform Cloud integration

This page describes how to configure HCP Waypoint to interact with your Terraform Cloud organization. Platform engineers often perform this task.

## Overview

HCP Waypoint application templates and add-on definitions both leverage Terraform Cloud no-code modules to deploy applications and their underlying infrastructure. As a result, you must provide HCP Waypoint with your Terraform Cloud organization name and team token so it can connect to Terraform Cloud.

When an application developer uses a template or installs an add-on, HCP Waypoint calls the Terraform Cloud API to create a new workspace and trigger a Terraform Cloud run. When an application developer destroys an application or uninstalls an add-on, HCP Waypoint triggers a destroy run and deletes the workspace from Terraform Cloud.

You must configure HCP Waypoint with Terraform Cloud before you can create or use an HCP Waypoint template or add-on.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP account with HCP Waypoint enabled. Refer to [HCP Account](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account) for information about creating an account.
- A Terraform Cloud organization with **Plus tier**. Terraform Cloud must be Plus tier to use Terraform Cloud no-code modules and the private module registry.

## Usage

1. From the HCP Waypoint overview, go to the **Settings** menu.
1. Enter in the name of the Terraform Cloud organization and the Terraform Cloud team token. The team token must have permissions to:
    - Read modules from the private registry
    - Create Terraform workspaces
    - Create Terraform runs
1. Click **Save**.

## Next steps
