# HCP Vault tiers and features

HCP Vault is a fully-managed, cloud-hosted version of Vault Enterprise which can be deployed in AWS or Azure.
HCP Vault includes most Vault Enterprise features, details on the differences can be viewed [here](/hcp/docs/vault#feature-parity).
HCP Vault currently has trial, pay-as-you-go and annual contract based pricing options. For more details refer to
[HCP’s Billing Models](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#billing-models).

## Pay-as-you-go

Organizations can get started right away with Development, Standard and Plus tiers with pay-as-you-go pricing for HCP Vault.

HCP Vault clusters are priced with an hourly base cost which can vary depending on the tier, size, and region the cluster is
deployed in. Development tier clusters are only charged an hourly base cost while Standard and Plus tier clusters have an
additional flat-rate hourly cost per Vault client. Refer to the [client overview](/hcp/docs/vault/client) and [FAQ](/hcp/docs/vault/client/faq)
for more details on client based pricing. Pricing information is available on our [pricing page](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/pricing)
and within the HCP portal when creating HCP Vault clusters.

Client counts are based on a monthly billing period. Clients are only counted once during this period, starting from the first time they authenticate
into Vault and incur hourly charges. At the end of the month, the client counts are reset. Please note that it is not possible to delete clients or
reduce the client counts before the monthly billing period concludes. The client counts remain unchanged until the end of the billing cycle.

## Annual contracts

Standard and Plus tiers are also available with custom pricing through annual contracts. Please [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales)
for more information.

## Development tier

Development tier clusters are intended for sandboxing, prototyping and non-production Vault use cases. It is a single-node Vault instance with a 25
client count limit and is not subject to the [HashiCorp Cloud SLA](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sla).

Development clusters are only available in one size and do not include production grade features such as high availability, audit logging and metrics
streaming and snapshot restoration.

## Standard tier

Standard tier clusters are cost-effective, highly available production-grade Vault clusters managed by HCP with a 99.9% SLA and Silver Support level.
Features include, Vault audit log and telemetry streaming, backup and restore capabilities and version management.

## Plus tier

Plus tier clusters include everything from the Standard tier and capabilities to meet scaling, governance and compliance needs of organizations.
Gold level support is included and additional features include Vault Enterprise [Performance Replication](/vault/docs/enterprise/replication#overview),
[Sentinel Policies](/vault/tutorials/policies/sentinel), [Control Groups](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/control-groups) and
[Advanced Data Protection](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/advanced-data-protection).

| -------------------- | :-----: | :-----: |
| Small                |  2 vCPU |  8 GiB  |
