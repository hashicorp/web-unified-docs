# Login  MFA
HCP Vault offers several authentication types across all tiers to further secure authenticating. Login MFA is now supported and uses **Time-based One-time Password (TOTP)**, **Okta**, **Duo**, and **PingID**. Along with this support, new endpoints have been added as part of the login functionality.
