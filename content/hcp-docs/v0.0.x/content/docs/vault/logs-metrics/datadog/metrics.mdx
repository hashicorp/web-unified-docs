# Configure HCP Vault metric streaming to DataDog

For details on metrics scope and interpretation, see the [HCP Vault metrics
documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/logs-metrics).

<Note title="Availability">

HCP Vault metrics streaming is available for all
production grade clusters. The feature is not available for Development tier
clusters.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

To configure metrics streaming to Datadog, you will need to have:

- A HCP account with Admin or Contributor [role assigned in HCP](/hcp/docs/hcp/create-account)
- A production grade HCP Vault cluster
- Your Datadog region and [API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/)

   <Note>

   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/cloud/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault
   cluster.

   </Note>

## Enable metrics streaming

1. Log in to the HCP Portal and navigate to the **Vault clusters** page.

1. Click the Vault cluster you wish to enable streaming for and click **Metrics**.

1. Click **Enable metric streaming**.

1. From the **Stream Vault metrics** view, select **DataDog** as the provider and click **Next**.

1. Under Datadog configuration, enter your API Key and select the Datadog site
   region that matches your existing Datadog environment.

1. Click **Save**.

   <Note>

   At this time, HCP Vault only supports metrics streaming to one
   metrics endpoint at a time.

   </Note>

1. Once the metrics have been enabled, navigate to Datadog, and enable the
integration by clicking Install on the [integration
tile](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/hcp-vault). This
will install a sample HCP Vault dashboard, that comes with preset visualization
widgets to help make the most of your HCP Vault telemetry. You can find the
dashboard by searching for **HCP Vault Overview** from the [dashboard
list](https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists).

## Example Terraform configuration (optional)

Refer to the Terraform Registry [`hcp_vault_cluster` documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/vault_cluster#nested-schema-for-audit_log_config)
for more information.

```hcl
resource "hcp_vault_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_id = "vault-cluster"
  hvn_id     = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  tier       = "standard_large"
  metrics_config {
    datadog_api_key = "actual-api-key"
    datadog_region = "region"
  }
}
```

## Edit the metrics streaming configuration (optional)
