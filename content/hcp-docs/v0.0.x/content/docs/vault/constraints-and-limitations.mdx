# Constraints and limitations

## No access to root namespace

### Vault system API

Most endpoints under `/v1/sys` that require authentication are not available. An
exception has been made for the following endpoints:

- [`/sys/leader`](/vault/api-docs/system/leader)
- [`/sys/metrics`](/vault/api-docs/system/metrics)
- [`/sys/seal-status`](/vault/api-docs/system/seal-status)

## Admin token policy

The admin policy used to generate admin tokens is located in the customer admin namespace
and is named `hcp-root`. Although this policy is editable by the customer in their namespace, it should not
be edited. If needed, this policy will be updated to the general admin policy by HCP Vault, and all customizations by the user are removed.
By editing this policy, admin tokens will not act as `root` tokens in the namespace
and you will be restricted from performing all operations. In the future, we plan to limit the modifications of this policy
and/or regenerate this policy before generating an admin token. Currently, the recovery of this policy is manual for
the HCP operators and may delay recovery of your Vault cluster.

## Integrated Storage only

HCP Vault only supports raft integrated storage, and cannot be reconfigured to use Consul as a storage backend.

## TLS certificate authentication

Not available by default. When the TLS auth method is enabled for HCP Vault and the cluster's Vault UI is accesed via web browser, users may see a popup to select a client certificate. The pop-up can be closed and the Vault UI can still be accessed. To use the TLS authentication method in HCP Vault, please submit a support request [here](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have the feature enabled.

## AWS Cross Account Setup

Not available by default. HCP Vault on AWS can support cross-account access [for the AWS authentication method](/vault/docs/auth/aws#cross-account-access) and [AWS secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/aws#sts-assumerole), please submit a support request [here](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have the feature enabled.

## External storage for tokenization

The Transform Secrets Engine is available on HCP Vault Plus tier clusters, but [external storage for tokenization](/vault/docs/secrets/transform/tokenization#external-sql-stores) is not supported at this time.

## Diagnostic logs

Vault diagnostic (e.g. server) logs are not accessible to HCP Vault customers today. If you require assistance from the Support Team to help you troubleshoot a specific diagnostic issue, you can open a support ticket.

## External plugins

The [Oracle Database Secrets Engine](/vault/docs/secrets/databases/oracle) and [HashiCorp Partner Plugins](/hcp/docs/vault/integrations#hashicorp-partner-plugins) are the only external plugin currently available in HCP Vault. HCP Vault does not currently support user provided external Vault plugins. If you'd like to see future support of additional plugins on HCP Vault, please share feedback [here](https://hashicorp.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bOElUPCdFXaQOfr).

## Rate limits

Request rate limits are enforced on certain instance sizes. The response message
for rate limit enforcement will be similar to this example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
> hvac.exceptions.RateLimitExceeded: request path "transit/encrypt/example": 
rate limit quota exceeded, on post https://vault-cluster....
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

See [this article](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408930425107-Unexpected-error-Rate-limit-quota-exceeded) for more detail.

## Sentinel and Control Groups

Sentinel policies and Control Groups, part of Vault's governance and policy features, are only available for [Plus tier](/hcp/docs/vault/tiers-and-features#plus-tier) HCP Vault clusters. If you are using these features and need to scale your cluster to a different tier, it is recommended to delete existing Sentinel policies and remove any control group settings within existing ACL policies within your Vault instance. These features will only work in Plus tier clusters.

## KMIP secrets engine

All ADP features, including the KMIP secrets engine, are only available for [Plus tier](/hcp/docs/vault/tiers-and-features#plus-tier) HCP Vault clusters. The KMIP secrets engine is currently only available on AWS clusters. The KMIP listener can only be configured to the default port (5696).

## Namespace API lock constraints

When using the Namespace API lock functionality through the UI there are some limitations:
* Not possible to lock/unlock the cluster when its state is different than RUNNING/LOCKED.
* In the performance replication scenario, it's not possible to lock/unlock a secondary directly, 
you should instead operate on the primary which will then replicate the lock status to the secondary.
* Additionally, it's not possible to lock/unlock the primary when the secondary is not RUNNING/LOCKED.
