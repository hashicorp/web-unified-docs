# Administrative capabilities

The trust model for HCP Vault protects the operations invoked in the root
namespace (`admin`), including all system configurations.

## CORS settings

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that
allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its
own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. For more
information, refer to the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) documentation.

Vault allows you to manage CORS settings for your UI. Refer to the [Vault API
documentation](/vault/api-docs/system/config-cors) to learn
about the `/sys/config/cors` API endpoint.

You can manage the CORS settings for your UI using the HCP portal or via API.

## Custom UI headers

Some security systems may require that the UI serves custom headers to improve the
security of the underlying system. Vault allows you to manage custom headers to
be served by the UI. See the [Vault API
documentation](/vault/api-docs/system/config-ui#configure-ui-headers)
for details.

You can manage those UI header settings using the HCP portal or the API.

## Cluster resizing and changing tiers

HCP Vault allows you to change your clusters in place while maintaining the current configurations. The only current limitations are that no production-grade clusters can be scaled down to the Development tier and you must have enough resources to scale down or delete them accordingly.

You can use the HCP Portal or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs) to resize a current cluster up or down or change tiers.

## Delete clusters

You can soft delete HCP Vault clusters and recover the deleted clusters within
the grace period.

<Warning>

The project's [**Active resources**
page](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects#manage-resources) will not list the
soft-deleted HCP Vault clusters. If no active resources exist, users can delete
the project with no issue. However, once the project is deleted, [HCP
Support](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support) will not be able to restore the HCP Vault
clusters.

</Warning>
