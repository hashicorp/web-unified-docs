# HCP Vault Overview

HCP Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp
to allow organizations to get up and running quickly. HCP Vault uses the same
binary as self-hosted Vault, which means you will have a consistent user
experience. You can use the same Vault clients to communicate with HCP Vault as
you use to communicate with a self-hosted Vault.

**NOTE:** Currently, HCP Vault clusters can be created on either AWS or Azure running in
multiple regions across North America, Asia, and Europe. We will support additional cloud providers in the future.

## Why HCP Vault?

Vault running on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) enables users to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys within one unified cloud-based platform.

The benefits of HCP Vault are:

- **Reduce operational overhead:** Push-button deployment, fully managed
  upgrades, and backups mean organizations can focus on adoption and integration
  instead of operational overhead.

- **Increase security across clouds and machines:** Secure your infrastructure
  across all your environments through a single interface and globally control
  and restrict access to sensitive data and systems.

- **Control cost:** Reduce the number of systems, licenses, and manual overhead
  by centralizing secrets management with HCP Vault.

- **Day zero readiness:** Modern cloud security to quickly secure applications,
  access, and data from day zero.

- **Reliability:** HashiCorp has experience supporting thousands of commercial Vault
  clusters and HCP Vault brings that expertise directly to users.

- **Ease of use:** HCP Vault is built around making cloud security automation
  simple. Get up and running instantly so that you can onboard applications and teams easily.

## Feature parity

The table below compares the features available on the self-managed Vault
Enterprise and HCP Vault.

<Note>

For the self-managed Vault Enterprise clusters, audit logging is a manual
configuration. Similarly, if your self-managed Vault is running Vault with Integrated Storage,
you can configure an automatic data snapshot. However, HCP Vault automates the
audit logging process.

- [Automatic data snapshots](/vault/tutorials/raft/raft-storage#automated-snapshots)

</Note>

## HCP Vault on Azure

HCP Vault on Azure includes all features found on AWS with the exception of following features which are planned:

- Snapshots retained for 30 days after cluster deletion to [support cluster restore](/hcp/docs/vault/high-avail-disaster-recover#cluster-deletion-and-snapshot-restore)
- Oracle Database Secrets Plugin
- KMIP Secrets Engine

## Self-managed vs. HCP Vault cluster

Here is a quick comparison between a self-managed Vault cluster and an HCP Vault
cluster.
