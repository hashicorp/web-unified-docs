# Single Sign-On Overview

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) allows organizations to configure SAML 2.0 SSO
(Single Sign-On) as an alternative to traditional user management with GitHub
and email-based options. This can help mitigate Account Take Over (ATO) attacks,
provide a universal source of truth to federate identities from your identity
provider (IDP), and help you better manage user access to your organization.

This page provides an overview of SSO for HCP and how to add, update and delete SSO configurations for an organization. 

## Managing an HCP Organization with SSO Enabled

Organization owners and admins can configure SSO. The **Single Sign-On** page in **Settings** displays a summary of the current SSO configuration.


### Users

When you enable SSO for an organization, the user invitations feature is no longer offered. You must provision new users through the external identity provider.

User accounts that join through SSO are limited to that one organization within HCP and canâ€™t be associated with an existing personal account such as GitHub or email. After you provision a new user, HCP automatically grants them the least privileged role of organization [Viewer](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#user-permissions). An HCP administrator can then manually update and increase their user permissions on the [HCP Access Control](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/access/users) page.

Existing personal user accounts can still access the organization unless an administrator removes them. Existing SAML user accounts with emails matching the configured SSO domain must log in with the SSO URL link. This link is available on the **Single Sign-On** page in **Settings**.

### Admins and Owners

The administrator who owns the organization and enabled SSO can still use their original, non-SSO account to sign in to the HCP web portal and access the SSO-enabled organization. If they previously signed in through GitHub, they can continue doing so. If they signed in with an email and password, they can use a special [force email + password sign-in](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in?with=email) link. This is because the login page defaults to SSO and hides the password when an email matches the configured SSO domain.

The organization owner can also sign up with a new SSO user principal and promote themselves to **Admin** if appropriate. However, they cannot remove their old user account or transfer ownership. They can use them as a recovery option if the SSO configuration requires troubleshooting.

## Configure SAML SSO

Refer to the following pages for instructions to set up SSO for specific identity providers.

- [Okta](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso/sso-okta)
- [Azure Active Directory](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso/sso-aad)

## Configure OIDC SSO

Refer to the following pages for instructions to set up SSO for specific identity providers.

- [Okta](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso/sso-okta-oidc)
- [Azure Active Directory](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso/sso-aad-oidc)

~> **Note:**  If you are using Google Open ID connect then we do not recommend using an *external user type* since it would allow *any* user with a Google account to authenticate with *your* HCP Organization. Please refer to this documentation about [internal user type](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type).

## Update SSO

Organization owners and admins can edit an SSO configuration.

To edit SSO:

1. Click **Settings** and then click **SSO**. You will be redirected to the **Single Sign-On** page.
1. Open the **Manage** menu and select **Edit**. SAML users can modify the list of domains, the public signing certificate, and the endpoints.

SAML users can add and remove domains, but domains cannot be empty.

- Adding a new domain will allow users with an email address matching the domain to sign up as new SSO users. SSO users using email addresses for the other domains will not be affected. You must also provision new domains on your identity provider and configure them for the Auth0-SSO-Connection.
- Removing an existing domain will affect SSO users whose email addresses match
the removed domain. They can sign in through other methods but will become
different users in the database. Organization administrators can remove inactive
users from the organization.

## Delete SSO

Organization owners and admins can delete an SSO configuration from their organization.

!> **Warning:** When you delete an SSO configuration, no SSO user can sign in to HCP. Current SSO users will remain in the organization as **inactive**.

To delete SSO from an organization:

1. Select **Delete SSO Configuration** in the
**Manage** menu. A dialog appears for you to confirm the deletion of SSO from this organization.
1. Type **DELETE** and then click **Delete**.

After deletion, organization owners and admins can [re-invite users](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#invite-users) with the default Access Controls (IAM) system.
