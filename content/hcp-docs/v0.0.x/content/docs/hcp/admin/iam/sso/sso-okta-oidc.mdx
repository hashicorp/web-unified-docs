# Okta OIDC SSO Configuration

This page explains how to set up SSO in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) with the Okta identity provider. Refer to [SSO Overview](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/sso) for details about how to manage organizations with SSO enabled.

## Configure OIDC SSO

Organization owners and admins can set up SSO. To begin configuring SSO:

1. [Log in to HCP](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and go to your organization.
1. Click **Settings** and then click **SSO**. The Single Sign-On page appears.
1. Select **OIDC SSO**.
1. Click **Configure** selected **SSO** method. The Setup OIDC SSO page appears, where you will enter the required information for Okta.

## Verify Your Domain

You need a DNS record (secret value to set as TXT) to prove ownership of a domain. HCP uses the domain to match the email addresses for SSO. You must use different SSO domains for each HCP organization. If you try to reuse a domain name, the DNS connection request will fail.

To verify your domain:

1. Copy the verification TXT record from the HCP SSO configuration to the DNS records of any email domains your organization uses.
1. Return to the **HCP Settings** page and add your email address domains.
1. Click **Verify domains**.

~> **NOTE:** If the verification is successful, you can continue configuring SSO. If the request fails, your changes to the DNS records may not have propagated yet. It can take up to 72 hours.

1. Click the **Create App Integration** button.
