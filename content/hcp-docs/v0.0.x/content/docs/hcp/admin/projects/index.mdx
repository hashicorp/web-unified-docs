# Projects

An organization contains one or more projects. A user selects a project to
create HCP resources such as [HashiCorp Virtual Networks
(HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) and server clusters. The organization has the high
level view of those projects.

You can use projects to segment access within an organization, such as by team,
use cases, or environment (e.g. development, staging, production, etc.). The
billing summary will report the usage by project.

Here are important characteristics about HCP projects:

- [HCP service quotas](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support#service-quotas) remain at the
  organization level and they are not enforced per project.

- An [organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs) can have up to 10 projects. 

   <Note>

   Refer the [HCP
   Support](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support) page to learn more about the service
   quotas.

   </Note>

- HCP resource names (e.g. cluster name) are unique per project and not per
  organization.

- You cannot deploy an HCP Vault or HCP Consul cluster if an HVN belongs to a
  different project.

- To delete a project, all resources under the project must be deleted or
  deactivated first. See the [manage resources](#manage-resources) section.

## Create a project

Users with organization contributor, admin, or owner roles can create new
projects. If an organization contributor creates a new project, the user
automatically becomes the admin of that project. (Refer to the [User
Permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#user-permissions) for information about
the roles you can assign.)

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your
   organization.

   <Note>

   If you have logged in before, the portal opens the last project you were in.
   Navigate back to the organization level from the breadcrumbs, or click on the
   HashiCorp icon at the top-left to choose your organization.
   
   </Note>

1. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.

1. Click **+ Create project**.

1. Enter the **Project name** and **Project description**.

1. Click **Create project** to complete.


## Manage projects

Users with project admin role can edit the existing project name and
description, or delete the project. (Refer to the [User
Permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#user-permissions) for information about
the roles you can assign.)

1. Log into [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your
   organization.

1. Select **Projects** in the sidebar.

1. Expand the menu next to the project you wish to modify, and select **Edit
   project** to edit the project name or description, or select **Delete** to
   delete the project.

1. Select **View project** will take you to the project setting page where you
   can find the **project ID**.


## Manage resources

The **Active Resources** page lists all resources created in the project. To
delete a project, all active resources must be deleted or deactivated. If an
active resource exists, HCP will block users from deleting the project. This
page helps you to identify what resources are still active in the project.
