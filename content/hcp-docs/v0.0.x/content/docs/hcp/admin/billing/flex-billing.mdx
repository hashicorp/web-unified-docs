# HashiCorp Flex Billing

## What is HashiCorp Flex?

HashiCorp Flex<sup>TM</sup> is a pricing program that allows customers to commit to a specific amount of spend upfront and draw down that committed balance through consumption of cloud services on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform. The program gives customers access to tiered usage pricing, deep discount options, and the flexibility to use the commitment across the HashiCorp Cloud Platform, including Terraform Cloud Plus Tier, HCP Vault, HCP Consul, HCP Packer, and Cloud Support.

The support level specified for each product in your contract determined the SLAs. Services with Development Edition defaults to Bronze level support.

## HashiCorp Flex Metric Definitions

HashiCorp Flex customers can access the complete Flex consumption pricing table on the HCP portal billing page. Below is a summary of the pricing metrics for eligible cloud services included in Flex. Some of these metrics are billed slightly differently from HCP pay-as-you-go pricing.

| Eligible Cloud Service                       | Pricing Metric                                                             | Billing Unit (Frequency)           | Metric Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Usage Metering and Cost Calculation

Billing metrics are metered by incremental count or by time, with usage and costs accrued so far in the month displayed and updated in the billing page every hour. Usage and costs are finalized and deducted from your Flex balance and an invoice is sent at the end of every month.

HCP tallies some metrics, such as Vault clients and Packer requests, incrementally for each month. Each subsequent unit is priced based on the pricing tier, and the count resets at the beginning of the following month.

Other metrics such as clusters, Terraform managed resources, and service instances are metered over time. At the end of every hour, HCP checks the billing unit count for the last hour. It then applies tiered pricing, support uplift, and any discounts to calculate the total charge and add it to the running balance. The billing usage summary updates every hour, though calculations may delay up to 30 minutes. For example, by 10:30am, the usage summary and balance will reflect charges for hours 9am to 10am.

The following image shows an example of the usage summary table displayed in the account summary screen.
![Usage Summary](/img/docs/flex-usage-summary.png 'Usage Summary')

In the usage summary, the **Quantity** shows the total sum of the units (hours for metrics metered over time, raw count for incremental metrics), and **Amount** shows the total cost associated with that metric with any tiered pricing and discount applied. Terraform does not include the cost of any resources that qualify under the free tier. The rate shown is an estimated blended rate calculated by dividing the amount by the quantity. The blended rate can change within the month as usage reaches higher usage tiers. Multiplying quantity and rate may result in slight discrepancies due to rounding in the UI.

- Vault clients and Consul service instances are aggregated across the entire organization for pricing purposes. For example, increasing client count on one Vault cluster will decrease the marginal price of each additional client for all Vault clusters in the organization as higher pricing tiers are reached.
- Terraform metrics are aggregated across all Terraform Cloud organizations linked to Flex.

The usage summary will still display the number of clients and service instance hours attributed to each cluster separately, but will show the same blended rate for each cluster. For example, if Vault cluster A has one client and Vault cluster B has three clients, a quarter of the total Vault client charge to the organization will be attributed to cluster A, and three-quarters to cluster B, with the same blended rate for both.

The usage summary values are estimates until the statement is finalized at the end of the month. This allows for HCP to finalize price tiers and backfill any missing data.

## Terraform Cloud

Managed resources determine Terraform Cloud Standard and Plus Edition consumption. HCP measures these metrics across all Terraform Cloud Plus organizations linked to Flex, so usage in one organization puts you in a higher tier discount and lowers the prices for usage in other organizations too.

| Metric                        | Quantity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Estimate Rate                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Hourly Peak Managed Resources | The sum of the maximum number of managed resources in each workspace in an hourly billing period. <br /><br /> HCP charges for a managed resource on a per-hour basis, from the time of resource provisioning until destruction. Each partial hour counts as a full hour. The hourly rate is based on the total number of Hourly Peak Managed Resources aggregated across all Terraform Cloud Organizations linked to the HCP organization within a billing hour. | The managed resource pricing is tiered. The hourly rate for each managed resource depends the total number of managed resources tracked in state across all of your Terraform Cloud organizations. |

## HCP Vault

Vault clusters and Vault clients determine HCP Vault consumption. These metrics are metered across clusters in your HCP organization, meaning more usage in one cluster can lower the rate of others. ‘Starter’ edition Flex clusters are not available in Flex billing.

| Metric        | Quantity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Estimate Rate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Vault Cluster | The cost and usage information for each Vault cluster is displayed separately. The quantity shows the time duration of each cluster that has been actively running for the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The hourly rate is based on the Service “Edition” (i.e., Development, Standard, Plus) and the Vault Cluster size (i.e., Small, Medium, Large). This is a flat hourly rate per cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Vault Client  | The quantity displayed in each cluster is the number of Vault clients authenticated with that cluster within the month. Note that each Vault client is counted once within a billing month, no matter how many times it has been active. A single Vault Client, which authenticates to multiple Vault Clusters (excluding Vault Development Clusters), are counted as multiple billable Vault Clients. | The Vault Client rate is tiered. The monthly rate of each client is based on the total number of Vault Clients aggregated across all Vault Clusters (excluding Development Clusters) within the billing month. The estimated rate is a blended rate and will be the same across all clusters. This is calculated by dividing the total client cost by the total number of clients across all clusters within the month. |

| Secrets       | Each Secret is charged on a per-hour basis, from the time a secret is created until it is destroyed. The hourly rate is based on the total number of Secrets within each edition, within a single HCP org, within a billing hour. Each partial hour is billed as a full hour.                                                                                                                          | The hourly rate is based on the total number of secrets (i.e., 1-100, 101-200, 200+) and the support tier (i.e. Silver or Gold).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| API calls     | The quantity displayed in each cluster is the number of Vault clients authenticated with that cluster within the month. Note that each Vault client is counted once within a billing month, no matter how many times it has been active. A single Vault Client, which authenticates to multiple Vault Clusters (excluding Vault Development Clusters), are counted as multiple billable Vault Clients. | Each API call is charged equally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## HCP Consul

Consul clusters and Consul service instances determine HCP Consul consumption. These metrics are metered across clusters in your HCP organization, meaning more usage in one cluster can lower the rate of others.

| Metric                  | Quantity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Estimate Rate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Consul Cluster          | The cost and usage information for each Consul cluster is displayed separately. The quantity shows the time duration of each cluster that has been actively running for the month.                                                                                                                              | The hourly rate is based on the Service “Edition” (i.e., Development, Standard, Plus) and the Consul Cluster size (i.e., Small, Medium, Large). This is a flat hourly rate per cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Consul Service Instance | Each service instance is metered from when it is registered until it is deregistered. One service instance registered for one hour is a single “Service Instance Hour.” The total quantity for each cluster is calculated by summing all service instance hours for the month (excluding Development Clusters). | Consul Service Instance rates are presented hourly, but metered on a per-minute basis for higher accuracy. The Consul Service Instance pricing is tiered. The per-minute rate of each service instance is based on the total number of registered service instances aggregated across all Consul Clusters (excluding Development Clusters) within a billing minute. The estimated rate is a blended rate and will be the same across all clusters. This is calculated by dividing the total service instance hours cost by the total quantity across all clusters within the month. |

## HCP Packer

Images and Requests determine HCP Packer consumption. These metrics are tiered based on usage across your HCP organization, meaning the more usage you have, the less per unit price you pay.

| Metric  | Quantity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Estimate Rate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Images  | Each image is metered from the time its metadata is stored in the registry until the metadata is deleted. One image stored for one hour is a single "Image hour.” The total quantity is calculated by summing all image hours for the month. | The image pricing is tiered. The hourly rate of each “Image” is determined by the Service Editions (i.e., Standard, Plus) and the total number of “Images” within a billing hour. The estimated rate for each service edition is a blended rate, calculated by dividing the total cost of images by the total image hours within the current billing month. |
| Request | Total number of requests for the month                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The Request pricing is tiered. The rate of each “Request” is determined by the Service Editions (i.e., Standard, Plus) and the total number of “Requests” within a billing month. The estimated rate is the blended rate, calculated by dividing the total cost of requests by the total number of requests within the current billing month.               |
