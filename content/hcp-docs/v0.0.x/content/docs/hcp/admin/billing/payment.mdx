# Payments

When you first create a new HCP organization, you are automatically granted $50 in trial credits to apply toward HCP services. You can optionally add a credit card during setup. If you skip this option, your organization remains in trial status until the free credits are depleted or until you add a credit card. Refer to [Add a Credit Card](#add-a-credit-card) for instructions.

## Add a Credit Card

1. Open your Project or Organization dashboard and click on the **View billing** link in the Billing summary tile.
1. Click **Payment methods** in the sidebar.
1. Click **Add credit card** and enter your billing information when prompted.

HCP generates your final invoice and the remainder of your usage. If your organization does not have any remaining credits or another payment method, you will not be able to deploy any new paid resources.

## Set Up an Entitlement or HashiCorp Flex<sup>TM</sup> Billing Contract

If you purchased an Entitlement or HashiCorp Flex<sup>TM</sup> contract to use in HCP, you must share your HCP organization ID with your HashiCorp account manager so that they can locate your HCP organization and activate your contract.

Your unique organization ID is a string that can be found by navigating to the ‘Organization Settings’ page in the HCP portal.

The following image shows the location of the HCP organization ID in the organization settings screen.

### Terraform Cloud and Flex

If you want to use Terraform Cloud Plus with HashiCorp Flex<sup>TM</sup>, you will need to provide your Terraform Cloud organization names to your account manager. If you need to link Terraform Cloud organizations to Flex after the orders process, contact [Support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
