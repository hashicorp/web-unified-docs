# Organizations

Organizations are parent-level entities in HCP that contain one or more
[projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects), and each project contains resources
including [HashiCorp Virtual Networks (HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) and server
clusters. Users can be a member of multiple organizations if invited by the
admin of other organizations. However, you can only create and own one
organization for your HCP account. An organization can have up to 10
[projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects).

This page describes how to create and manage an organization in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

## Create an organization

<Tip title="Note">

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account for the first
time, the HCP Portal takes you to the [create
organization](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/orgs/create) page where you can
specify the name and country of your organization. Once your organization is
ready, you can proceed to [invite users](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#invite-users)
to your organization or start creating HCP resources.
