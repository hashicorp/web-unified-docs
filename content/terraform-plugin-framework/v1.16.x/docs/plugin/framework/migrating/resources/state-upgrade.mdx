# State upgraders

This page explains how to migrate resource `StateUpgraders` in SDKv2 to
`UpgradeState` in the plugin framework.

## Background

When you update a resource's implementation in your provider, some changes may
not be compatible with old versions. You can implement state upgraders in your
provider to automatically migrate resources provisioned with old schema
configurations. Refer to [State
Upgrade](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/state-upgrade) in the framework
documentation for details about implementing state upgraders.

## Migrating state upgraders

In SDKv2, state upgraders are defined by populating the `StateUpgraders` field
on the `schema.Resource` struct. Refer to [State
Migration](/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/state-migration) in the SDKv2
documentation for details.

In the framework, you implement the
[`ResourceWithUpgradeState`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#ResourceWithUpgradeState)
interface on your resource to upgrade your resource's state when required.

The following code shows a basic implementation of the `stateUpgraders` field in
SDKv2.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="SDKv2">

```go
func resourceExample() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        StateUpgraders: []schema.StateUpgrader{
            {
                Version: int,
                Type:    cty.Type,
                Upgrade: StateUpgradeFunc,
            },
            /* ... */
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following code shows how you ensure that your resource satisfies the
`resource.ResourceWithUpgradeState` interface with the framework.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="Framework">

```go
var (
    _ resource.Resource                 = &resourceExample{}
    _ resource.ResourceWithUpgradeState = &resourceExample{}
)
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following code shows how you define an `UpgradeState` function with the
framework.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="Framework">

```go
func (r *resourceExample) UpgradeState(context.Context) map[int64]resource.StateUpgrader {
    return map[int64]resource.StateUpgrader{
        0: {
            PriorSchema:   *schema.Schema,
            StateUpgrader: func(context.Context, UpgradeStateRequest, *UpgradeStateResponse),
        },
        /* ... */
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `UpgradeState` function returns a map from state versions to structs that
implement state upgrade from the given version to the latest version.

### Migration Notes

Remember the following differences between SDKv2 and the framework when
completing the migration.

- In SDKv2, you implement state upgraders populating the `StateUpgraders` field
  on the `schema.Resource` struct. In the framework, you ensure that your
  resource implements the
  [`ResourceWithUpgradeState`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#ResourceWithUpgradeState)
  interface, and then define an `UpgradeState()` function on the resource.
- In SDKv2, state upgraders apply each state upgrader in turn. For example,
  version 0 => version 1, version 1 => version 2. In the framework, each
  `StateUpgrader` function is required to perform all of the necessary
  transformations in a single step. For example, version 0 => version 2, version
  1 => version 2.

### Examples


#### Migrating state upgraders

In SDKv2 the `schema.Resource` struct has a `StateUpgraders` field that holds
`[]schema.StateUpgrader` struct(s).

In the framework, ensure your resource type implements the
`ResourceWithUpgradeState` interface, and add an `UpgradeState()` function to
upgrade your resource state.

The following example from the shows the state upgrade functions for the
`example_resource` resource with SDKv2.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="SDKv2">

```go
func exampleResource() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        Schema:        exampleSchemaV2(),
        SchemaVersion: 2,
        StateUpgraders: []schema.StateUpgrader{
            {
                Version: 0,
                Type:    exampleResourceV0().CoreConfigSchema().ImpliedType(),
                Upgrade: exampleResourceStateUpgradeV0,
            },
            {
                Version: 1,
                Type:    exampleResourceV1().CoreConfigSchema().ImpliedType(),
                Upgrade: exampleResourceStateUpgradeV1,
            },
        },
        /* ... */
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following example shows the implementation of the
`exampleResourceStateUpgradeV0` function with SDKv2.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="SDKv2">

```go
func exampleResourceStateUpgradeV0(_ context.Context, rawState map[string]interface{}, _ interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
    if rawState == nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("example resource state upgrade failed, state is nil")
    }

    rawState["example_attribute"] = "value"

    return rawState, nil
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following shows the same section of provider code after the migration.

This code implements the `ResourceWithUpgradeState` interface on the
`exampleResource` type by defining an `UpgradeState` function. The
`UpgradeState` function returns a map from each state version (int64) to a
`ResourceStateUpgrader` struct.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="Framework">

```go
func (r *exampleResource) UpgradeState(context.Context) map[int64]resource.StateUpgrader {
    schemaV0 := exampleSchemaV0()
    schemaV1 := exampleSchemaV1()

    return map[int64]resource.StateUpgrader{
        0: {
            PriorSchema:   &schemaV0,
            StateUpgrader: upgradeExampleResourceStateV0toV2,
        },
        1: {
            PriorSchema:   &schemaV1,
            StateUpgrader: upgradeExampleResourceStateV1toV2,
        },
    }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following code implements the `upgradeExampleResourceStateV0toV2` state
upgrade function.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="Framework">

```go
func upgradeExampleResourceStateV0toV2(ctx context.Context, req resource.UpgradeStateRequest, resp *resource.UpgradeStateResponse) {
	type modelV0 struct {
		ID    types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
	}

	var exampleDataV0 modelV0

	resp.Diagnostics.Append(req.State.Get(ctx, &exampleDataV0)...)
	if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
		return
	}

	exampleDataV2 := exampleModelV2{
		ID:    exampleDataV0.ID,
	}

	exampleDataV2.ExampleAttribute = types.StringValue("value")

	diags := resp.State.Set(ctx, exampleDataV2)
	resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
