# Actions

<Highlight>

Action support is in technical preview and offered without compatibility promises until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

Actions are an abstraction that allow providers to expose side-effects that interact with remote systems. Practitioners
can use actions to express workflows that don't strictly fit into typical [CRUD resource management](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources),
such as disaster recovery or ad-hoc maintenance. Actions can be invoked directly with the Terraform CLI or with
a trigger in a plan/apply workflow.

## Action types

Each action in a provider has a statically defined action type in the [schema](/terraform/plugin/framework/actions/implementation#schema-method), which informs Terraform how the action can be used
by the practitioner and what effect the action can have on [resource state](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/terraform-concepts#state).
Currently, the only available action type is:

- [Unlinked](/terraform/plugin/framework/actions/implementation#unlinked-action) - An action type that cannot cause changes to state.

Action types that can modify resource state are not available in Terraform 1.14, but are planned for future releases.

## Implementation

Learn about how to [implement code](/terraform/plugin/framework/actions/implementation) for an action in the framework.
