# Migrating from SDKv2 to the plugin framework

This guide helps you migrate a Terraform provider from SDKv2 to the plugin
framework. We recommend that you migrate your SDKv2 providers to the framework
to take advantage of the improved data abstractions and other features that make
it easier to use, and because it represents the future of Terraform plugin
development. Refer to [Plugin framework
benefits](/terraform/plugin/framework-benefits) to understand how the framework
makes provider development easier and [Feature
comparison](/terraform/plugin/framework/migrating/benefits) for a detailed
comparison between the SDKv2 and the framework.

## How to migrate a provider to the framework

To migrate your provider to the Framework, you will need to implement code for
your provider, resources, data sources, and other Terraform features with the
libraries and data types implemented by the Framework instead of the SDKv2
equivalents. For providers that only implement a few resources, data sources,
and other Terraform features, you can implement the migration in a single
release cycle. For most complex providers, we recommend that you use muxing to
allow you to release incremental versions of your provider that implment some
features in SDKv2 and others in the framework.

The Terraform configuration for your provider's resources and other Terraform
features should not change when migrating to the framework, and most migrations
should not require users to modify their Terraform configuration. Remember to
only introduce breaking changes to your provider in [major version
updates](/terraform/plugin/best-practices/versioning#versioning-specification).

### Migrate without muxing

The overall process to migrate a provider without using muxing consists of the
following steps.

1. Ensure your SDKv2 provider uses up to date versions of the Go language and
   SDKv2, and includes comprehensive unit tests.
1. Migrate each resource, data source, and other Terraform feature from SDKv2 to
   the framework.
1. Remove the SDKv2 from your provider codebase.
1. Ensure that your tests continue to pass to avoid introducing breaking changes
   to your provider.
1. Release the framework version of your provider.

For a more detailed set of steps, follow our [recommended
workflow](/terraform/plugin/framework/migrating/workflow#migrate-without-muxing)
to migrate your provider from SDKv2.

### Migrate using muxing

The overall process to migrate a provider using muxing consists of the following
steps.

1. Ensure your SDKv2 provider uses up to date versions of the Go language and
   SDKv2, and includes comprehensive unit tests.
1. Implement muxing between SDKv2 and the framework in your provider server.
1. Incrementally migrate each resource, data source, and other Terraform feature
   from SDKv2 to the framework. Ensure that your tests continue to pass to avoid introducing breaking changes to your provider.
1. Follow your normal release process during the migration to release bug fixes
   and other updates alongside migration changes.
1. Once you have migrated your provider, schema, and all resources and other
   Terraform features to the framework, remove SDKv2 from your provider.

For a more detailed set of steps, follow our [recommended
workflow](/terraform/plugin/framework/migrating/workflow#migrate-with-muxing) to
migrate your provider from SDKv2 using muxing.

## Testing migration

As you complete the migration, we recommend that you follow Test Driven
Development by writing tests to ensure that the migration does not affect
provider behavior. Refer to [Testing
Migration](/terraform/plugin/framework/migrating/testing#testing-migration) for
details and examples.

## Framework tutorials

Before migrating your provider to the framework, you may wish to familiarize
yourself with the framework by completing the [plugin
framework](/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework) tutorial collection.

## Framework documentation

While migrating your provider, refer to the [framework
documentation](/terraform/plugin/framework) in addition to this migration guide.
