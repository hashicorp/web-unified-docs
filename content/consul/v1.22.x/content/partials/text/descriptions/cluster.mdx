A collection of Consul agents that are aware of each other is called a _cluster_. The terms _datacenter_ and _cluster_ are often used interchangeably. In some contexts, such as the [_admin partitions_](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/admin-partition) feature included with Consul Enterprise, a cluster may refer to collection of client agents.
