# API gateways on Kubernetes overview

This topic provides overview information about API gateways for Consul on Kubernetes. 

## Introduction

API gateways enable external network clients to access applications and services running in a Consul datacenter. Consul API gateways can also forward requests from clients to specific destinations based on path or request protocol. Systems that access services in the mesh may be internal or external to your organizational network. _North-south traffic_ is a common term to describe this type of network traffic.

## Workflow

In order to configure an API gateway on Consul you need the following steps:

1. [Verify technical specifications](#verify-technical-specifications) for your cluster
1. [Enable API gateway](#enable-api-gateway)
1. [Deploy a listener](#deploy-a-listener)
1. [Define a route](#define-a-route)

## Verify technical specifications 

To successfully configure API gateway for your Kubernetes cluster, there are some criteria that require attention. OpenShift users need to enable specific parameters in the Helm chart.

Refer to [API gateway for Kubernetes technical specifications](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/tech-specs) for guidance.

## Enable API gateway

The Consul API gateway ships with Consul and is automatically installed when you install Consul on Kubernetes.

Refer to [Enable API gateway for Kubernetes](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/enable) to verify the configuration parameters in your installation.

## Deploy a listener

API gateways have one or more listeners that serve as ingress points for requests to services in a Consul service mesh.

Refer to [Deploy API gateway listeners in Kubernetes](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/listener) for guidance.

## Define a route

Routes are rule-based configurations that allow external clients to send requests to services in the mesh.

[Define API gateway routes on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/route) helps you define a route from your API gateway to a service.

Routes can be tuned to define complex traffic shaping, refer to [Reroute HTTP requests](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/reroute) to learn hot to define URL rewrite rules for the services in your Kubernetes cluster.

API gateways can also be used to expose services exported by peer datacenters, [Route traffic to peered services](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/peer) contains guidance on how to expose an exported service using API gateway.

## Guidance

### Reference

| Configuration | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| [`Gateway`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/gateway)                       | Defines the main infrastructure resource for declaring an API gateway and listeners on the gateway. It also specifies the name of the `GatewayClass`. | 
| [`GatewayClass`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/gatewayclass)             | Defines a class of gateway resources used as a template for creating gateways. The default gateway class is `consul` and is suitable for most API gateway implementations.  | 
| [`GatewayClassConfig`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/gatewayclassconfig) | Describes additional gateway-related configuration parameters for the `GatewayClass` resource. | 
| [`Routes`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/routes)                         | Specifies paths from the gateway listener to backend services. | 
| [`MeshServices`](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/peer)                   | Enables routes to reference services in Consul. | 
| [`ServiceIntentions`](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/service-intentions)     | Specifies traffic communication rules between services in the mesh. Intentions also enforce rules for service-to-service traffic routed through a Consul API gateway. |
