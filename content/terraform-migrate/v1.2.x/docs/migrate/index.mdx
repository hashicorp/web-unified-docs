#  Migrate to HCP Terraform

The `tf-migrate` CLI automatically migrates your Terraform Community Edition state and variable values to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise. It also updates your local configuration with the new state storage location and optionally creates a pull request to update your code repository.

**Hands-on**: Complete the [Migrate to HCP Terraform in bulk](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/bulk-migrate-hcp) tutorial to get started with `tf-migrate`.

## Overview

Complete the following steps to install and configure `tf-migrate`:

1. [Download and install `tf-migrate`](/terraform/migrate/install).
1. Configure `tf-migrate` to [authenticate](/terraform/migrate/authenticate#connect-to-hcp-terraform-or-enterprise-terraform) to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise. 
1. Optionally [authenticate your VCS provider](/terraform/migrate/authenticate#authenticate-your-vcs-provider) with your version control provider API key to create a pull request with your configuration changes.
1. Optionally enable [logging](#enable-logging) so that you can troubleshoot potential issues that may occur during the migration process.

## Supported backends

The `tf-migrate` tool supports migrating state from the following backends to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise:

- [local](/terraform/language/backend/local)
- [azurerm](/terraform/language/backend/azurerm)
- [consul](/terraform/language/backend/consul)
- [cos](/terraform/language/backend/cos)
- [gcs](/terraform/language/backend/gcs)
- [http](/terraform/language/backend/http)
- [Kubernetes](/terraform/language/backend/kubernetes)
- [oss](/terraform/language/backend/oss)
- [pg](/terraform/language/backend/pg)
- [s3](/terraform/language/backend/s3)

The `tf-migrate` CLI does not support migrating state from an existing `cloud` integration or `remote` backend.

## Supported workspace workflows

The `tf-migrate` tool can create CLI- or VCS-driven HCP Terraform workspaces. It will only prompt you to create a VCS-driven workspace if you meet the following requirements:

- Your local configuration is a Git repository.
- Your local Git repository has GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket configured as a remote.
- Your HCP Terraform organization has at least one VCS OAuth connection configured for GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

If your HCP Terraform organization has more than one VCS connection configured, `tf-migrate` will ask you to choose which VCS connection to use.

If your local configuration does not meet all of the above requirements, `tf-migrate` automatically creates a CLI-driven workspace instead.

## Enable logging

You can enable detailed logging by setting the `TF_MIGRATE_ENABLE_LOG` environment variable to `true`. When you enable this setting, `tf-migrate` writes the logs to the following locations, depending on your operating system:

| Platform | Location |
| -------- | -------- |
| macOS and Linux | `/Users/<username>/.tf-migrate/logs/<commandName>/<date>.log` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\<username>\.tf-migrate\logs\<commandName>\<date>.log` |

You can set the `TF_MIGRATE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to one of the following values to change the verbosity of the logs in order of decreasing verbosity: 

- `TRACE`
- `DEBUG` 
- `INFO` 
- `WARN`
- `ERROR`

## Additional configuration

You can create an optional configuration file to modify the `tf-migrate` CLI behavior and specify the path to the configuration file when you run `tf-migrate prepare`. Any command-line flags you provide with these commands override the configuration file. Refer to the [configuration reference](/terraform/migrate/reference/configuration) for additional information.
