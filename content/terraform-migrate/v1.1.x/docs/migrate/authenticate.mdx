# Authenticate `tf-migrate`

To use `tf-migrate`, you must authenticate with HCP Terraform or the Terraform Enterprise instance that you are migrating your state to.

## Connect to HCP Terraform or Enterprise Terraform

The `tf-migrate` tool uses your locally configured Terraform CLI API token. If you have not authenticated your local Terraform installation with HCP Terraform, use the `terraform login` command to create an authentication token.

```
$ terraform login

Terraform will request an API token for app.terraform.io using your browser.

If login is successful, Terraform will store the token in plain text in
the following file for use by subsequent commands:
   /Users/redacted/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json

Do you want to proceed?
 Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

 Enter a value: yes
```

Terraform opens a browser to the HCP Terraform sign in screen, where you can then enter a token name in the web UI, or leave the default name. Click **Create API token** to generate the authentication token.

HCP Terraform only displays your token once. Copy this token, then when the Terraform CLI prompts you, paste the user token exactly once into your terminal. Press **Enter** to complete the authentication process.

## Authenticate your VCS provider

`tf-migrate` can optionally create a pull request that updates the state storage location specified in your Terraform configuration. To do this, `tf-migrate` uses the GitHub or GitLab Cloud API, and requires an API token with permissions to modify your Git repository.

To configure your API token, set the `TF_GIT_PAT_TOKEN` environment variable

```
$ export TF_GIT_PAT_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

### GitHub connection requirements

If your Terraform files are stored in GitHub, you must configure an API token that meets the following requirements:

- The token must be a classic token. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for additional information.
- The token must have the `repo` OAuth scope.

### GitLab connection requirements

If your Terraform files are stored in GitLab Cloud, you must configure an API token that meets the following requirements:

- The token must be a personal access token. Refer to the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens) for additional information.
- The token must have `read_repository` and `write_repository` scopes.
