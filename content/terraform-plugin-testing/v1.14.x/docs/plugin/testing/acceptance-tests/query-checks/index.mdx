description: >-
  Query Checks are test assertions that can inspect query during a TestStep. The testing module
  provides built-in Query Checks for common use-cases, and custom Query Checks can also be implemented.

# Query Checks

During the **Lifecycle (config)** [mode](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/teststep#test-modes) of a `TestStep`, the testing framework will run `terraform apply`.

The execution of `terraform apply` results in a [query file](/terraform/language/query), and can be represented by this [JSON format](/terraform/internals/json-format#query-representation).

A **query check** is a test assertion that inspects the query file. Multiple query checks can be run, all assertion errors returned are aggregated, reported as a test failure, and all test cleanup logic is executed.

Refer to:

- [Resource Query Checks](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/query-checks/resource) for built-in managed resource and data source query checks.
