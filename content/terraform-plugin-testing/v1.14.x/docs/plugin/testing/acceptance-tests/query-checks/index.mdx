description: >-
Query Checks are test assertions that can inspect the query results during a Query TestStep. The testing module
provides built-in Query Checks for common use-cases, and custom Query Checks can also be implemented.

# Query Checks
During the **Query** [mode](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/teststep#test-modes) of a `TestStep`, the configuration supplied is used as the contents of a `.tfquery.hcl` query file and the testing framework will run `terraform query`.

The execution of `terraform query` results in a set of query results.

A **query check** is a test assertion that inspects the query results. Multiple query checks can be run, all assertion errors returned are aggregated, reported as a test failure, and all test cleanup logic is executed.

Refer to:

- [Query Result Query Checks](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/query-checks/query-results) for built-in query checks.
- [Custom Query Checks](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/query-checks/custom) for defining bespoke query checks.
