  Terraform includes a framework for constructing acceptance tests that
  imitate applying one or more configuration files.

# Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests for Terraform providers are a feature of the
[`terraform-plugin-testing`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing)
framework. The testing framework uses standard Go features such as the `go
test` command.  It runs a local Terraform binary to perform real plan, apply,
refresh, and destroy operations, and enables developers to make assertions
about what happens during those actions.

When testing the happy path, developers can make assertions about the data
stored in state after successfully provisioning a resource. When testing
unhappy paths, developers are able to make assertions about errors returned by
Terraform, non-empty plans, and the actual cloud resources created by
Terraform.

~> **Note**: Acceptance tests can create and destroy real infrastructure
resources; as a result, they can incur expenses and consume quotas. The testing
framework provides a way to check that all resources created by tests are
destroyed. Refer to the [requirements and
recommendations](#requirements-and-recommendations) section.

## Test files

Terraform follows many of the Go programming language conventions with regards
to testing. Tests are placed in a file that matches the file under test, with
an added `_test.go` suffix. Here's an example file structure:

```
terraform-plugin-example/
├── provider.go
├── provider_test.go
├── example/
│   ├── resource_example_compute.go
│   ├── resource_example_compute_test.go
```

To create an acceptance test in the example `resource_example_compute_test.go`
file, add a test function with name that begins with `TestAcc`.

```
import "testing"

func TestAccExampleComputeResource(*testing.T) {
}
```

## Requirements and recommendations

Acceptance tests have the following requirements:

- **[Go](https://go.dev/)**: The most recent stable version.
- **Terraform CLI**: Version 0.12.26 or later.
- **Provider Access**: Network or system access to the provider and any
  resources being tested.
- **Provider Credentials**: Authorized credentials to the provider and any
  resources being tested.
- **`TF_ACC` environment variable**: Set to any value. Prevents developers from
  incurring unintended charges when running other Go tests.

We also recommend the following when running acceptance tests:

- **A separate Account**: Use a separate provider account or namespace for
  acceptance testing. This prevents Terraform from unexpectedly modifying or
destroying infrastructure due to code or testing issues.
- **Previous Terraform CLI Installation**: Install Terraform CLI either into
  the operating system `PATH` or use the `TF_ACC_TERRAFORM_PATH` environment
variable prior to running acceptance tests. Otherwise, the testing framework
will download and install the latest Terraform CLI version into a temporary
directory for every test invocation. Refer to the [Terraform CLI Installation
Behaviors](#terraform-cli-installation-behaviors) section for details.

Each provider may have additional requirements and setup recommendations. Refer
to the provider's codebase for more details.

## Running Acceptance Tests

Use the [`go test`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/internal/test) command to run
acceptance tests. You can run the acceptance tests on any environment capable
of running `go test`, such as a local workstation [command
line](#command-line-workflow) or a [continuous integration
runner](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/continuous-integration),
such as GitHub Actions.

### Command Line Workflow

This example will execute all available acceptance tests in a provider
codebase:

```shell
TF_ACC=1 go test -v ./...
```

#### Makefiles

test to make sure the gnu domain is skipped

For convenience, provider codebases can place common tasks in a
[Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefiles).

This example defines a `testacc` target, which sets `TF_ACC` and the verbose
(`-v`) flag.

```make
testacc:
	TF_ACC=1 go test -v ./...
```

To run acceptance tests:

```shell
make testacc
```

-> **Note**: Refer to the [Environment
Variables](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/environment-variables)
section for more details about behaviors and valid configurations.

### Terraform CLI Installation Behaviors

The testing framework implements the following Terraform CLI discovery and
installation behaviors:

- If the `TF_ACC_TERRAFORM_PATH` environment variable is set, the framework
  will use that Terraform CLI binary if it exists and is executable. If the
framework cannot find the binary or it is not executable, the framework returns
an error unless the `TF_ACC_TERRAFORM_VERSION` environment variable is also
set.
- If the `TF_ACC_TERRAFORM_VERSION` environment variable is set, the framework
  will install and use that Terraform CLI version.
- If both the `TF_ACC_TERRAFORM_PATH` and `TF_ACC_TERRAFORM_VERSION`
  environment variables are unset, the framework will search for the Terraform
CLI binary based on the operating system `PATH`. If the framework cannot find
the specified binary, it installs the latest available Terraform CLI binary.

## Troubleshooting

This section lists common errors encountered during testing.

### Unrecognized remote plugin message

```
terraform failed: exit status 1

	stderr:

	Error: Failed to instantiate provider "random" to obtain schema:
Unrecognized remote plugin message: --- FAIL: TestAccResourceID (4.28s)

	This usually means that the plugin is either invalid or simply needs to
be recompiled to support the latest protocol.
```

This error indicates that the provider server could not connect to Terraform
Core. Verify that the output of `terraform version` is v0.12.26 or above.

## Next Steps

The next step is to create _Test Cases_ using Terraform's testing
framework.build and verify real infrastructure.

Proceed to [_Test Cases_](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/testcase).
