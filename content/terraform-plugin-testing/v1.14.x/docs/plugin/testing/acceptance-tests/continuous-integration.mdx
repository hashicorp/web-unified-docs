# Acceptance Tests: Continuous Integration

## GitHub Actions Workflow

If using [GitHub](https://github.com/), run acceptance testing via [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other continuous integration
runners are also supported.

Ensure the [GitHub Organization settings for GitHub
Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization)
and [GitHub Repository settings for GitHub
Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository)
allows running workflows and allows the `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`,
and `hashicorp/setup-terraform` actions.

Create a [GitHub Actions
workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
file, such as `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, that does the following:

- Runs when pull requests are submitted or on [other
  events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)
as appropriate.
- Uses [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to checkout
  the provider codebase.
- Uses [`actions/setup-go`](https://github.com/actions/setup-go) to install Go.
- Uses
  [`hashicorp/setup-terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform)
to install Terraform CLI.
- Runs the `go test` command with the appropriate environment variables and
  flags.

Use the
[`matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)
strategy for more advanced configuration, such as running acceptance testing
against multiple Terraform CLI versions.

The following example workflow runs acceptance testing for the provider using
the latest patch versions of the Go version in the `go.mod` file and Terraform
CLI 1.11:

```yaml
---
name: Terraform Provider Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/test.yaml'
      - '**.go'

permissions:
  # Permission for checking out code
  contents: read

jobs:
  acceptance:
    name: Acceptance Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version-file: 'go.mod'
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: '1.11.*'
          terraform_wrapper: false
      - run: go test -v -cover ./...
        env: TF_ACC: '1'r

  unit:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version-file: 'go.mod'
      - run: go test -v -cover ./...  ```
```

The following example workflow runs acceptance testing for the provider using
the latest patch versions of Go version in the `go.mod` file and Terraform CLI
0.12 through 1.11:

```yaml
name: Terraform Provider Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/test.yaml'
      - '**.go'

permissions:
  # Permission for checking out code
  contents: read

jobs:
  acceptance:
    name: Acceptance Tests (Terraform ${{ matrix.terraform-version }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        terraform-version:
          - '0.12.*'
          - '0.13.*'
          - '0.14.*'
          - '0.15.*'
          - '1.0.*'
          - '1.1.*'
          - '1.2.*'
          - '1.3.*'
          - '1.4.*'
          - '1.5.*'
          - '1.6.*'
          - '1.7.*'
          - '1.8.*'
          - '1.9.*'
          - '1.10.*'
          - '1.11.*'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version-file: 'go.mod'
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: ${{ matrix.terraform-version }}
          terraform_wrapper: false
      - run: go test -v -cover ./...
        env:
          TF_ACC: '1'
  unit:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version-file: 'go.mod'
      - run: go test -v -cover ./...
