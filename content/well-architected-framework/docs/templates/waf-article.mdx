# [Article Title]

[What is the topic and why it is important. Include the rationale and business case in this introduction section. Explain the value and context for implementing this practice.]

## [Single focused section header]

[Practical, implementation-focused content focused on ONE specific aspect of the topic. When helpful, include the who/when/why to provide context. If it is clear from reading the content who/when/where, then you do not need to explicitly add it. Focus on how to implement the practice.]

[Continue with practical guidance, examples, and implementation steps. Use written prose rather than bullet points or lists unless absolutely necessary for clarity.]

## [Optional second focused section header - only if needed]

[Additional practical content, implementation guidance, or advanced considerations. Keep sections focused and concise. Only include if the topic truly requires a second section.]

## Next steps

[Brief summary of what was covered and what the reader learned.]

## Writing Style Notes

### Structure and Headers
- **Single topic focus** - Each article should focus on ONE specific, actionable topic
- **1-2 sections maximum** - Keep content atomic and focused, avoid excessive sections
- **Action-oriented headers** - Use verbs like "Build", "Implement", "Configure" instead of "-ing" forms (unless it's the main action)
- **Integrated rationale** - Include "why" in the introduction, not as separate sections
- **Natural flow** - Introduction → Implementation → Next steps
- **Atomic content** - If a topic has multiple aspects, consider splitting into separate articles

### Tone and Voice
- **Conversational and practical** - Tutorial-like, implementation-focused, NOT command-like
- **Colloquial and flowing** - Natural prose that doesn't sound directive or "command-like"
- **Uses "you" consistently** - Direct address to the reader
- **No contractions** - Use "you are" not "you're", "it is" not "it's"
- **Hands-on guidance** - Focus on "how to" with context for "why" and "when"
- **Avoid ambiguous language** - Replace "it helps you" with specific phrases like "These practices help you", "These principles help you"

### Content Characteristics
- **Implementation-focused** - How to do things, practical guidance
- **Written prose preferred** - Avoid bullet points and lists unless absolutely necessary for clarity
- **Contextual information** - Include who/when/why when helpful, but do not force it
- **Concise and atomic** - Focus on one specific practice or principle
- **Cloud-agnostic** - High-level principles that work across environments
- **HashiCorp integration** - Naturally incorporate relevant HashiCorp tools when applicable
- **Short and focused** - WAF articles should be shorter and more atomic than pillar overviews
- **MVP approach** - Focus on essential content that requires minimal net-new creation

### Link Formatting
- **Internal HashiCorp links** - Use relative paths like `/vault/docs/audit` NOT `https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/audit`
- **External links** - Keep full URLs for non-HashiCorp resources (AWS, Azure, etc.)
- **Verify all links** - Ensure all internal and external links are accurate and working
- **Remove non-existent links** - Do not link to WAF articles that don't exist

### HashiCorp Tool Integration
- **Natural integration** - Mention HashiCorp tools when relevant to the topic
- **Not heavy-handed** - Don't be overly promotional or patronizing with HashiCorp references
- **External resources section** - Include HashiCorp documentation links in external resources
- **Accurate terminology** - Use correct product names and feature terminology

### Key Differences from Pillar Overviews
- **Shorter and more focused** - Single topic, not comprehensive overview
- **More conversational** - Less formal than pillar overviews
- **Implementation details** - Specific how-to guidance
- **Less strategic** - Focus on specific practices rather than organizational strategy
- **Tutorial-like** - Practical, actionable content
- **Adapted tutorial content** - WAF articles are largely adapted from existing tutorial content
