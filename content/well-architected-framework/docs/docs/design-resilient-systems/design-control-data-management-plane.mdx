# Design control, management, and data planes for resilient infrastructure

Infrastructure planes represent the foundation for your infrastructure
architecture. Infrastructure planes define how:

- Your systems make decisions (control plane)
- Operators interact with the infrastructure and services (management plane)
- Workloads execute and data flows (data plane)

Understanding and properly designing each plane is critical for building
resilient, scalable, and secure infrastructure that can meet operational and
compliance requirements.

## What are infrastructure planes

Modern infrastructure operates across three distinct architectural layers, each
serving a specific purpose in your overall system design:

- **Control plane:** Makes decisions about workload placement, routing, service
  health, and system state. Examples include Kubernetes schedulers, Consul
  servers, and Nomad server clusters.
- **Management plane:** Provides interfaces for operators and automation to
  configure, monitor, and administer infrastructure. Examples
  infrastructure-as-code platforms such as Terraform, configuration management
  tools like Ansible, and observability tools like Promethus, Loki, and Grafana.
- **Data plane:** Executes decisions made by the control plane and moves actual
  application data and traffic. Examples include container runtimes, service
  mesh proxies, and application workloads.

## Conceptual design considerations for infrastructure planes

Designing infrastructure planes requires careful consideration of architecture
patterns, scalability requirements, and organizational constraints. Poor design
in any single plane can cascade into failures across your entire infrastructure,
resulting in downtime, security vulnerabilities, or operational inefficiencies.

The following considerations will help you make informed decisions about your
infrastructure design. At this of the design, focus on conceptual requirements.
When making conceptual design decisions, your focus should be on your needs, and
how it should work rather than specific tools or vendors.

- **Identify team responsibilities:** Understand which teams are responsible for
  managing each plane, and the services within each plane. Define clear
  ownership boundaries to avoid confusion during incidents and clearly document
  team experience.
- **Define scaling and reliability requirements:** Consider and test for the
  baseline, average, and peak loads for each service.
- **Establish geographical distribution requirements:** Determine if your
  application requires fault domains within a specific region, multi-region
  scaling, dedicated local instances in each region, and the impact of data
  residency requirements such as GDPR or CPPA.
- **Plan for separation of duties:** Define roles and responsibilities for teams
  managing each plane, and application or service within the plane.
- **Design for high availability:** Ensure each plane, and each service operates
  independently and that you can perform a failover without impacting availability.
- **Identify network segmentation needs:** Logically isolate traffic between
  planes, and services within each plane. Open ports between planes and services
  only as necessary. Ensure services can connect to only the required resources
  to operate.

Document each of the considerations for your infrastructure planes. Having a
well documented conceptual design helps you make informed decisions during
the logical design phase. Here is an example of how you might document
conceptual requirements and constraints.

## Logical design considerations for infrastructure planes

Once you have created a conceptual design, and documented requirements for each
plane, you can consider logical requirements such as the type of services
needed. This stage is slightly deeper than the conceptual design, and focuses on
the capabilities needed to meet your requirements. Do not focus on specific
vendors, but rather type of tool or service needed like whether you need a service mesh,
load balancer, infrastructure-as-code, configuration management, or specific
type of storage.

You should consider whether to use managed services, self-managed services, or a
hybrid approach. For example, do you want to use a hyper-scale public cloud provider, a
specialized cloud provider, software-as-a-service (SaaS), or self-managed platform.

- **Data plane:** Hyper-scale public cloud provider with multiple availability
  zones, and self-hosted infrastructure.
- **Control plane:** Managed container services and virtual machine services.
- **Management plane:** Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) by default, fallback to
  self-managed services on a hyper-scale public cloud provider as needed.

Managed services can improve resilience by reducing operational overhead, but
require careful consideration to ensure each service meets your availability,
data locality, security, and disaster recovery requirements.

## Physical design considerations for infrastructure planes

Physical design builds off the conceptual and logical design requirements and
constraints. When writing the physical design, you select specific services,
tools, and vendors to implement your infrastructure planes. Ensure that each
selected service meets your documented requirements and constraints. For example:

- **Data plane:** Amazon Web Services, Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Cloud for
  compute and storage services instead, and KVM-based virtualization for
  specialized self-hosted infrastructure.
- **Control plane:** Managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS) for hyper-scale
  platforms and OpenShift for self-hosted container orchestration.
- **Management plane:** GitHub for version control and CI/CD, HCP Terraform for
  infrastructure-as-code automation, and Datadog for observability.

## Next steps

In this guide you learned about why it is important to properly design your
control, management, and data planes. Following the conceptual, logical, and
physical design process helps ensure that your infrastructure meets your
organizations requirements, and helps you focus on requirements rather than
vendor tools or features. Design control, management, and data planes is part of
the [Design resilient
systems](/well-architected-framework/design-resilient-systems) pillar.

After you have completed your design, review the Secure control, management, and
data planes guide to ensure that your design meets security best practices.
