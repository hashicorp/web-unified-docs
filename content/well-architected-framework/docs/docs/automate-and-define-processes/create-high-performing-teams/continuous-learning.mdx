# Continuous learning

Technologies and tools change rapidly. Your team should encourage a learning mindset through regular training opportunities. Investing in your team's knowledge and skills not only improves individual performance but also enhances overall team productivity and the quality of your projects.

When you introduce a new tool to the team, the introduction should include training materials; either instructor-led or on-demand. Additionally, encourage your team to take certification when available, as they are an excellent opportunity to verify understanding. You should refresh both certification and training every two years for existing tools.

You should encourage your team to seek out training opportunities that they think will benefit their skills and careers. Offering a yearly education budget or a license to an online training provider is an excellent way to lower your team's barrier to additional training. You can also provide dedicated training time during work hours to encourage your team to learn these crucial skills. An example is allowing built-in training time to their weekly work hours, such as a daily or weekly allowance.

It is important to know that you can find valuable training material for free on the tool's provider's website. For example, many cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP have free labs, tutorials, and documentation. HashiCorp has a library of free tutorials and documentation for each of our products, accessible to all skill levels.
