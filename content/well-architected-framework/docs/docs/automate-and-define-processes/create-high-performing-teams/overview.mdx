# Overview

Implementing tools, workflows, processes, and applications requires collaboration and clear communication across teams and organizations. You can enable teams to operate efficiently with company-wide guiding principles, resources to develop specialized skill sets, efficient communication, and collaboration.

HashiCorp's guiding principles define our foundational characteristics and help us make decisions. They also enable us to have a shared understanding that we can use to act collectively and consistently. These shared principles help us align our project and deployment goals. After you have established your own set of guiding principles, use them to inform your decisions at the start of a project, at regular checkpoints, and during retrospectives.

Additionally, many of our individual, team, and company practices are available on our How HashiCorp Works site. These shared practices are concrete examples that also enable us to operate consistently across the organization.
