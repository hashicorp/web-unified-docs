# Define security strategy

Security is an important component of every step of the application deployment pipeline. You should consider the security implications from when you write your code, when you design your deployment patterns, and day two and beyond while your code runs in production. 

[Vault](/vault) lets you secure, store, and tightly control access to sensitive data, such as passwords, certificates, and API keys. Vault also manages dynamic secrets for services such as databases or cloud providers. These dynamic secrets protect malicious access to your services by providing valid credentials for short windows of time, automatically generating new credentials for your application to use. Finally, Vault also provides encryption-as-a-service, which lets you encrypt data in your application without the need to manage the protection and rotation of encryption keys.

HCP Vault Dedicated is a hosted version of Vault Enterprise operated by HashiCorp. You can use the same CLI, API, and UI to communicate with HCP Vault Dedicated as you use to communicate with a self-hosted Vault Enterprise. HCP Vault Dedicated offers automated deployments, fully managed upgrades, and backups to reduce operational overhead.

HCP Vault Radar automates detecting and identifying unmanaged secrets in your code, and related services such as version control systems. It continuously scans for secrets, personally identifiable information, and non-inclusive language in real-time to alert you when it finds sensitive information exposed in your code base. When used with the Vault Radar agent, you can check if you already store the secrets in HCP Vault Dedicated or Vault Enterprise. If the secrets are not stored in Vault, the agent can copy the secrets into Vault so you can begin the remediation process.

## Securely access infrastructure

Once you deploy your infrastructure and applications, you may need a way to provide secure access to your team. Traditional remote access solutions typically provide access to entire network segements, which is an anti-pattern to the practice of least privilege.

[Boundary](/boundary) is a secure access management solution that provides secure access to your infrastructure without exposing the underlying network, or granting access to the entire network.

You can install Boundary Enterprise on your own infrastructure, use HCP Boundary (a managed version of Boundary Enterprise), or a hybrid approach where HCP Boundary uses self-managed workers to connect to your existing infrastructure without exposing network resources.
