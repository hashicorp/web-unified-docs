# Application infrastructure

Depending on your organization's deployment strategy, you may provision your infrastructure separately from deploying your application. For example, you might deploy your database, configure IAM roles, or set up access in your secrets management software. In this case, we recommend using a predictable, repeatable process for deploying your application stack.

Every time they apply changes to their configuration, it updates the infrastructure.](/img/well-architected-framework/terraform-ops-workflow.png#light-theme-only)

[Terraform](/terraform) is an infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you define
and manage infrastructure resources through human-readable configuration files.
Terraform has over [4000
providers](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers), letting you deploy
to any cloud provider or platform that has an API.

HCP Terraform manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment instead of on your local machine. HCP Terraform securely stores your state files, letting your team safely collaborate on the same Terraform deployment by preventing simultaneous deployments. HCP Terraform offers features that enhance the Terraform workflow, such as the following:

- Connect to your VCS provider so that you can develop your infrastructure using a workflow similar to application development.
- Store modules in a private registry, making it easy to reuse Terraform code in your organization.
- Run tasks let you connect to third-party services during a Terraform run lifecycle. This lets you add additional steps to your deployment process to do things like scan for security vulnerabilities or analyze your configuration to ensure that you are deploying the latest version of a machine image.
- Granular access controls to manage team permissions. This level of control ensures that only authorized team members can make changes, enhancing the security of your infrastructure deployment.
- Policy enforcement to enforce guardrails on the Terraform configuration your organization writes. For example, you can write policies to limit the size of VMs the configuration deploys, or confine deployments to defined maintenance windows.
