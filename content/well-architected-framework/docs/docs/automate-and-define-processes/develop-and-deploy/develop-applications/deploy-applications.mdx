# Application deployment

Your application deployment process depends on how you package your application. For example, the process differs when you deploy your application on virtual machines (VM) versus deploying to a container orchestrator like  Kubernetes or Nomad.

If your applications run on virtual machines directly, we recommend that you package your application in the machine image itself rather than install it after deploying the VM. This immutable infrastructure approach means you know exactly what's running on the VM, simplifies scaling, and reduces deployment time. When you need to update the application, build a new machine image and deploy it as a new VM. This prevents ad-hoc changes from putting the VM in an unknown state.

You can use Terraform to manage and deploy your applications to a container orchestrator like Nomad or Kubernetes. By using Terraform, you have a unified workflow to manage your application and infrastructure resources.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a system for automating the deployment and scaling of containerized workloads. You tell Kubernetes the desired state of your workload, and it will automatically determine how to meet those requirements. The [Terraform Kubernetes provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest) lets you interact with the Kubernetes API to deploy and manage workloads. Helm is a popular packaging tool for Kubernetes workloads, and you can also deploy these packages with the [Helm Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs).

### Nomad

[Nomad](/nomad) lets you orchestrate and manage workloads such as containers, standalone binaries, and batch jobs. Nomad [jobs](/nomad/docs/job-specification) define the entire workload to deploy to Nomad. Jobs include information about the applications to deploy, where to deploy them, how to network them, and more. To manage, update, and scale jobs, you can update your job file with the desired resources and Nomad will automatically reconcile the changes that you require.

While you can manage workloads with the [Nomad CLI](/nomad/docs/commands) or API, we recommend that you use Terraform or Nomad Pack. The [Terraform Normad provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/nomad/latest) lets you manage workloads using infrastructure-as-code, just as you would with your infrastructure. You can also use [Nomad Pack](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack), a package manager and templating tool for Nomad.
