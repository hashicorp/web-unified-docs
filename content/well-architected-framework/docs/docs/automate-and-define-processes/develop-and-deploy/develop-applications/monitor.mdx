# Monitor application and infrastructure

Your application needs to know how to talk to other services on the network. As application architecture becomes more distributed, it can be challenging to configure and maintain communication between applications and services. As your application scales, it may be more difficult to troubleshoot issues and balance traffic to multiple instances of your services.

[Consul](/consul) is a networking solution that lets you securely connect your services and manage traffic.

HashiCorp resources:

- [Get started with Consul on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes)
- [Get started with Consul on VMs](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms)

If you already have existing solutions to collect and monitor metrics in your organization, Consul and many other HashiCorp tools can integrate with existing solutions. For example, if your metrics solution requires an agent to be installed on the machine your application runs on, you can use Packer to create a golden image that includes the agent, ensuring that every application that you build automatically collects and sends metrics.

- [Monitor your application health and performance with Consul proxy metrics](/well-architected-framework/reliability/reliability-deploy-application-monitoring-components)

## Monitor your infrastructure

Monitoring your infrastructure, and supporting tools is an important part of maintaining a secure environment. Monitoring lets you understand how your infrastructure operates, and helps you identify and resolve issues before they affect your users.

## Next steps

In this section of [Develop applications](/well-architected-framework/automate-and-define-processes/develop-and-deploy/develop-applications/introduction), you learned how to monitor your applications and infrastructure. Develop applications is part of the [Automate and define processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/automate-and-define-processes).
