# Introduction

These documents describe the best practices for creating an application delivery strategy with HashiCorp tools. A well-designed deployment strategy helps you deliver your application to production faster and catch bugs before your users run into them. A complete deployment strategy has five fundamental components:

1. Development environment
1. Package applications
1. Provision infrastructure
1. Deploy applications
1. Connect and monitor applications and infrastructure

There are also two components to consider throughout the entire deployment process:

1. Define your security strategy
1. Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline

Your organization may have additional requirements for delivering your applications. For example, your security guidelines may require you to perform static code analysis on your codebase before you package it. After you package your application, your operations team may have a package registry that they require you to upload your application to.

Once you identify and implement each required step of your deployment strategy, we recommend automating them in a CI/CD pipeline. These pipelines will help every team in your organization adopt your deployment strategy by enforcing your designed strategy.
