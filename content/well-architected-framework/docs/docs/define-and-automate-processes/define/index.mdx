# Define processes for automation

Before automating infrastructure and application workflows, you must document current processes, standardize workflows across teams, and establish foundational practices like version control and artifact management. Defining processes creates a stable foundation for automation, prevents automating broken workflows, and ensures teams follow consistent practices that scale across your organization.

This section guides you through defining your processes in the following progression:

1. Document what you currently do manually
1. Standardize processes across teams and platforms
1. Implement version control for infrastructure
1. Create reusable infrastructure components
1. Centralize artifact and package management

After defining your processes, you can implement automation for continuous integration, deployment, and testing covered in the [Automate processes](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/automate) section.

## Why define processes before automating

Defining processes before implementing automation addresses the following challenges:

- **Prevent automating broken workflows:** Teams that automate without documenting current workflows create fast, reliable systems that produce incorrect results. Defining processes reveals inefficiencies, unnecessary steps, and logical errors that you can fix before implementing automation.

- **Establish measurable baselines:** Without understanding current performance—deployment duration, failure rates, time investment—you cannot measure automation's impact. Documented processes provide specific metrics that demonstrate automation value to stakeholders.

- **Enable knowledge transfer and reduce key person dependency:** When critical processes exist only in senior engineers' heads, vacations and departures create operational risk. Defined processes transfer knowledge to the entire team, reducing dependency on specific individuals.

- **Create foundation for consistent automation:** Inconsistent manual processes across teams result in fragmented automation that doesn't work across the organization. Standardized, documented processes ensure automation investments benefit all teams rather than solving point problems.

## Recommended reading order

Follow this progression through the Define section for best results:

### 1. Map your current workflows

Start by [mapping your current workflows](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/workflows) to document existing manual processes. Workflow mapping identifies which processes consume the most time, cause frequent failures, or block other work—helping you prioritize automation candidates. The workflow documentation template provides structure for capturing process steps, decision points, dependencies, and failure scenarios.

**Key outcomes:**
- Documented workflows with time investment and failure rates
- Identified automation candidates prioritized by impact
- Baseline metrics for measuring automation improvement
- Institutional knowledge captured in structured format

### 2. Standardize and automate workflows

After documenting current workflows, [standardize your workflows](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/standardize-workflows) across cloud providers and teams. Standardization eliminates provider-specific processes that require teams to learn different workflows for AWS, Azure, and GCP. Terraform and Packer create consistent workflows across platforms—define resources in HCL, preview changes with plan commands, and apply changes with standardized commands.

**Key outcomes:**
- Consistent workflow across all cloud providers
- Reduced cognitive load on operations teams
- Flexible technology choices without workflow disruption
- Automated workflow chains with HCP Terraform run triggers

### 3. Implement version control for infrastructure

With standardized workflows defined, [implement version control](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/version-control) for infrastructure configuration. Version control enables safe collaboration through code reviews, provides rollback capabilities when changes cause problems, creates audit trails for compliance, and documents infrastructure evolution over time. HCP Terraform integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to automate infrastructure changes when you merge code.

**Key outcomes:**
- Infrastructure configuration stored in Git with complete history
- Code review workflows for infrastructure changes
- Rollback capability when changes cause incidents
- Audit trails satisfying compliance requirements
- Automated infrastructure testing in CI/CD pipelines

### 4. Manage VCS configuration as code

After implementing version control for infrastructure code, [manage your VCS platform configuration as code](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/as-code/vcs-configuration). Managing GitHub or GitLab configuration with Terraform ensures consistent repository settings, enforces branch protection rules, and automates team permission management. This approach prevents configuration drift where repositories receive different security policies through manual changes.

**Key outcomes:**
- Consistent repository settings across all projects
- Branch protection rules enforced via code
- Team permissions managed declaratively
- Audit trail for VCS configuration changes

### 5. Create reusable infrastructure modules

With infrastructure in version control and standardized workflows established, [create reusable modules](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/modules) to standardize infrastructure components. Modules package infrastructure configurations into reusable units that teams share across your organization, reducing deployment time, enforcing security standards, and eliminating configuration duplication.

**Key outcomes:**
- Reusable infrastructure components shared across teams
- Security policies encoded in modules and applied consistently
- Reduced time to provision infrastructure
- Versioned modules preventing breaking changes

### 6. Centralize packages and dependencies

After creating reusable modules, [centralize your packages and dependencies](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/centralize-packages) with artifact managers. Centralized artifact management eliminates build failures from external dependencies, reduces security vulnerabilities through scanning, prevents configuration drift across environments, and improves build performance through caching.

**Key outcomes:**
- Single source for all build dependencies
- Vulnerability scanning before artifact distribution
- Cached dependencies surviving external outages
- Consistent artifact configuration across environments

### 7. Manage artifact repositories as code (optional)

For teams using general artifact repositories like Artifactory or Nexus, [manage artifact repository configuration as code](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/as-code/artifact-management). This extends infrastructure as code practices to your build infrastructure, ensuring consistent repository configuration, access policies, and retention rules across all environments.

**Key outcomes:**
- Artifact repositories configured consistently via Terraform
- Access control policies enforced across all repositories
- Repository provisioning automated for new teams
- Configuration changes tracked in version control

## Common patterns across all topics

All topics in the Define section share these patterns:

**Infrastructure as code first:** Every topic emphasizes defining configuration in code rather than through manual processes or web interfaces. Infrastructure as code enables version control, code review, testing, and automated deployment.

**Start with documentation:** Before implementing tools or automation, document current state. Understanding existing workflows, configurations, and pain points ensures you solve actual problems rather than theoretical ones.

**Enable collaboration:** Version control, standardized workflows, and documented processes all enable team collaboration. Multiple engineers can work simultaneously, review each other's changes, and share knowledge effectively.

**Provide audit trails:** Compliance requirements appear across multiple topics—version control for infrastructure changes, VCS configuration tracking, artifact repository access control. Code-based approaches naturally create audit trails satisfying security and compliance needs.

**Progressive implementation:** You don't need to implement all topics simultaneously. Start with workflow mapping and version control, then add modules and artifact management as your automation maturity grows.
