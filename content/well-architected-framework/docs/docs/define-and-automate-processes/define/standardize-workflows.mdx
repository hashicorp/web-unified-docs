# Standardize and automate workflows

Standardized workflows create consistency across your infrastructure operations, reducing complexity and improving team efficiency. When teams use provider-specific processes for AWS, Azure, and GCP, they spend time learning different workflows instead of focusing on business objectives. Inconsistent workflows also create operational risk because manual processes are error-prone and difficult to replicate across environments.

Terraform allows you to standardize your cloud infrastructure workflow to manage resources across cloud providers using a single language and process. Standard cloud infrastructure workflows let your team work more efficiently and enable you to choose the best service for the job rather than tying you to any one platform. HCP Terraform provides run triggers that chain multiple workflows together, allowing one workflow to automatically trigger another when it completes.

## Why standardize workflows

Standardized workflows address the following operational challenges:

- **Reduce operational complexity across cloud providers:** Managing infrastructure with provider-specific tools requires learning different workflows, CLIs, and APIs for each platform. Standardized workflows use consistent tooling and processes across all cloud providers, reducing the cognitive load on your team.

- **Enable flexible technology choices:** When your workflows depend on specific tools or platforms, switching technologies requires retraining your team and rebuilding processes. Workflow standardization focuses on the process rather than the underlying technology, allowing you to introduce new tools without disrupting operations.

- **Improve operational reliability through consistency:** Inconsistent manual processes lead to configuration drift, deployment errors, and unpredictable outcomes. Standardized automation workflows execute the same steps every time, reducing human error and making failures easier to diagnose.

- **Accelerate team onboarding and knowledge transfer:** When each team member follows different processes, institutional knowledge stays siloed with individuals. Standardized workflows document processes in code, making it easier for new team members to understand operations and contribute quickly.

## Standardize multi-cloud workflows

Terraform provides a consistent workflow for managing infrastructure across cloud providers. You define infrastructure in HCL configuration files, run `terraform plan` to preview changes, and execute `terraform apply` to create or modify resources. The workflow remains the same whether you provision AWS EC2 instances, Azure Virtual Machines, or GCP Compute Engine instances.

HCP Terraform extends this standardization to team collaboration. Run triggers connect workflows by automatically starting downstream runs when upstream workspaces complete. When one workflow completes, such as creating a Kubernetes cluster, a run trigger starts a second workflow to deploy applications or configure monitoring.

Packer standardizes image creation workflows across cloud providers. You define an image in a Packer template using HCL, specify provisioning steps with shell scripts or configuration management tools, and run `packer build` to create machine images for multiple platforms. The same Packer template produces AMIs for AWS, VHDs for Azure, and GCP images from a single configuration file.

### Standard Terraform workflow across providers

The following example shows a standardized Terraform workflow that works identically across AWS, Azure, and GCP:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tf">

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  # Standard backend configuration for team collaboration
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "your-organization"
    workspaces {
      name = "production-infrastructure"
    }
  }
}

# Standard workflow: define resources
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name        = "web-server"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

# Standard workflow: define outputs
output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This configuration demonstrates the standard Terraform workflow: define infrastructure in HCL, run `terraform plan` to preview changes, and run `terraform apply` to create resources. The workflow remains identical whether you provision AWS, Azure, or GCP resources—only the provider and resource types change.

### Chain workflows with HCP Terraform run triggers

HCP Terraform run triggers connect multiple workspaces, creating automated workflow chains. The following example shows a run trigger configuration that automatically deploys applications after infrastructure provisioning completes:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="run-trigger.tf">

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tfe = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tfe"
      version = "~> 0.51"
    }
  }
}

# Upstream workspace: provisions infrastructure
resource "tfe_workspace" "infrastructure" {
  name         = "production-infrastructure"
  organization = "your-organization"
}

# Downstream workspace: deploys applications
resource "tfe_workspace" "application" {
  name         = "production-application"
  organization = "your-organization"
}

# Run trigger: infrastructure changes trigger application deployment
resource "tfe_run_trigger" "infrastructure_to_application" {
  workspace_id    = tfe_workspace.application.id
  sourceable_id   = tfe_workspace.infrastructure.id
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This configuration creates two workspaces with a run trigger connecting them. When the infrastructure workspace completes a successful run, HCP Terraform automatically starts a run in the application workspace. The workflow chain ensures applications deploy using the latest infrastructure configuration without manual intervention.

### Standardize image creation with Packer

The following Packer template creates machine images for multiple cloud providers from a single configuration:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-app.pkr.hcl">

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
    azure = {
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/azure"
      version = "~> 2.0"
    }
  }
}

# Build configuration for AWS
source "amazon-ebs" "web_app" {
  ami_name      = "web-app-{{timestamp}}"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  region        = "us-east-1"
  source_ami_filter {
    filters = {
      name                = "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"
      root-device-type    = "ebs"
      virtualization-type = "hvm"
    }
    most_recent = true
    owners      = ["099720109477"]
  }
  ssh_username = "ubuntu"
}

# Build configuration for Azure
source "azure-arm" "web_app" {
  managed_image_name                = "web-app-{{timestamp}}"
  managed_image_resource_group_name = "packer-images"
  os_type                           = "Linux"
  image_publisher                   = "Canonical"
  image_offer                       = "0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy"
  image_sku                         = "22_04-lts"
  location                          = "East US"
  vm_size                           = "Standard_B2s"
}

# Standard provisioning workflow for all platforms
build {
  sources = [
    "source.amazon-ebs.web_app",
    "source.azure-arm.web_app"
  ]

  # Copy application files
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "app/"
    destination = "/tmp/app"
  }

  # Install and configure application
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx",
      "sudo cp -r /tmp/app/* /var/www/html/",
      "sudo systemctl enable nginx"
    ]
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This Packer template uses the same provisioning workflow (copy files, install packages, configure services) across AWS and Azure. Running `packer build web-app.pkr.hcl` creates an AMI for AWS and a managed image for Azure simultaneously. Teams learn one workflow that applies to all cloud platforms.
