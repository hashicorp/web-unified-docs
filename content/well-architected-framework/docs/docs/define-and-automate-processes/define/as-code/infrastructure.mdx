# Define your infrastructure systems

Before you can automate your infrastructure processes, you need to clearly define what infrastructure systems and tools you need. Using infrastructure as code (IaC) to define your systems creates a clear, version-controlled specification of your infrastructure that can be reviewed, tested, and automated.

## Define infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code lets you define your infrastructure using declarative configuration files, making it easier to understand your resource configurations and infrastructure topology. When you define your infrastructure as code, you can use the same engineering practices for your infrastructure as for application development, such as code review, automated deployment, and phased rollout.

Defining your infrastructure as code provides version control to track changes over time, collaboration to enable team review and feedback, consistency to ensure identical infrastructure across environments, testing to validate infrastructure changes before deployment, automation to enable automated deployment and management, and audit trails to maintain clear records of infrastructure modifications.

## Use Terraform to define your infrastructure

Terraform uses providers to interact with cloud resources and services. Terraform creates and manages these resources by storing the state of your infrastructure. You define the desired state of your infrastructure using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), and Terraform deploys and configures the resources to match your configuration.

Terraform enables you to create an infrastructure delivery workflow with four phases. Adopt involves composing infrastructure as code using HCL to provision resources from any infrastructure provider. Build focuses on creating infrastructure automation workflows to compose, collaborate, reuse, and provision infrastructure as code. Standardize establishes guardrails for security, compliance, and cost management through role-based access controls, policy enforcement, and audit. Scale extends workflow automation to all teams with self-service infrastructure as code.

Use Terraform to define your CI/CD infrastructure, container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Nomad, database systems including database instances and storage, monitoring and observability systems, security systems including identity providers and access controls, and version control systems including repositories and access controls.
