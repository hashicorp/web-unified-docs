# Security and authentication

Terraform can manage cloud native security along with vendor security tools. You can deploy identity and access management, encryption keys, network security like firewalls, and auditing. You can manage all these controls as code, allowing you to version and audit code changes. 

Terraform can also connect to secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault to use its security features. You will have more control over your secrets and can select a secret management solution that provides value to your specific organizational needs.

Benefits of using Terraform:
- Manage your cloud IAM
- Create your security and auth with IaC
- Integrate third-party security services into your cloud environment
Audit your security changes though VCS
- Connect to secret management tools like Vault
