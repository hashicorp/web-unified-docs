# Codify infrastructure and tools

Infrastructure as code (IaC) transforms infrastructure management from manual processes to declarative configurations that define your desired state. When you codify infrastructure, you define servers, networks, databases, and application platforms in configuration files that version control tracks, code review validates, and automation deploys. This approach eliminates manual changes that create configuration drift, enables teams to collaborate on infrastructure through pull requests, and provides audit trails showing exactly who changed what and when.

After [mapping your workflows](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/workflows) and [establishing version control](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/version-control), you can codify the infrastructure and tools that support your applications—from CI/CD systems to databases to monitoring platforms. This section guides you through defining different types of infrastructure as code using Terraform.

## Why codify infrastructure and tools

Codifying infrastructure and tools addresses the following operational and security challenges:

- **Eliminate configuration drift between environments:** Manual infrastructure changes applied through web consoles or CLI commands create inconsistencies between development, staging, and production. Infrastructure as code defines desired state in version-controlled files, ensuring identical configuration across all environments and making drift detection automatic.

- **Enable infrastructure collaboration and code review:** When infrastructure exists as manual changes or scattered scripts, team members make conflicting modifications without visibility. Infrastructure as code enables pull request workflows where teams review infrastructure changes, suggest improvements, and validate configurations before applying them to production.

- **Provide audit trails for compliance requirements:** Compliance frameworks require documented evidence of infrastructure changes including who made changes, what changed, and why. Infrastructure as code stored in version control creates comprehensive audit trails with commit messages, timestamps, and author information that satisfy regulatory requirements.

- **Reduce time to provision and modify infrastructure:** Manual infrastructure provisioning through web consoles requires clicking through multiple screens, documenting steps, and training team members. Infrastructure as code automates provisioning through single commands, reducing deployment time from hours to minutes and eliminating documentation burden.

## Infrastructure as code example

The following example shows basic infrastructure as code using Terraform to provision a web server with security groups and monitoring:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tf">

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  # Store state remotely for team collaboration
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "company-terraform-state"
    key    = "production/web-servers"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Security group allowing HTTPS traffic
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name        = "web-server-sg"
  description = "Allow HTTPS inbound traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "web-server-sg"
    Environment = "production"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

# Web server instance
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]

  tags = {
    Name        = "web-server"
    Environment = "production"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

# CloudWatch alarm for high CPU usage
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cpu" {
  alarm_name          = "web-server-high-cpu"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 2
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = 120
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 80

  dimensions = {
    InstanceId = aws_instance.web.id
  }
}

# Output server information
output "server_ip" {
  description = "Public IP address of web server"
  value       = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This configuration defines infrastructure including security groups, compute instances, and monitoring in a single file that version control tracks. Running `terraform plan` shows exactly what infrastructure will be created before deployment. Running `terraform apply` creates all resources with proper dependencies and relationships. The configuration documents infrastructure decisions in code, enables team review before deployment, and provides a foundation for automated infrastructure management.

## Manage infrastructure as code with Terraform

Terraform uses providers to interact with cloud platforms, SaaS services, and APIs. Terraform stores infrastructure state, tracks resources across deployments, and calculates the minimal changes needed to reach your desired configuration. You define infrastructure using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), specify desired state declaratively, and Terraform determines the actions needed to create or modify resources.

Beyond networks, servers, and databases, Terraform manages containers, machine images, CI/CD systems, monitoring tools, version control platforms, and security services. Terraform's infrastructure delivery workflow enables the following progression:

- **Adopt:** Compose infrastructure as code in Terraform files using HCL to provision resources from any infrastructure provider
- **Build:** Create infrastructure automation workflows that enable teams to compose, collaborate, reuse, and provision infrastructure as code
- **Standardize:** Establish guardrails for security, compliance, and cost management through role-based access controls, policy enforcement, and audit
- **Scale:** Extend workflow automation across the organization with self-service infrastructure as code and integration with VCS, ITSM, and CI/CD systems

The Terraform Registry provides a single source for finding providers and their supporting documentation. You can find official, partner, and community providers, modules, policy libraries, and run tasks in the Terraform Registry.

Modules package and reuse resource configurations with Terraform, standardizing infrastructure deployments across your organization. You can find publicly available Terraform modules for configuring common infrastructure in the Terraform Registry, or create custom modules tailored to your organization's needs. HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise include private module registries for sharing modules internally within your organization.
