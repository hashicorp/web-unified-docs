# Define your database infrastructure

Before you can automate database processes, you need to clearly define what database systems and configurations you need. Using infrastructure as code to define your database infrastructure creates consistent, version-controlled specifications for database provisioning, management, and operations.

## Define databases with Terraform

Terraform can define, deploy, manage, and interact with database management systems. You can use cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure to deploy database services such as RDS, and vendor providers to deploy databases like CockroachDB and MongoDB.

Define your database instances using infrastructure as code. For cloud-managed databases, define RDS instances, parameter groups, and subnet groups for AWS, Azure SQL Database and PostgreSQL instances for Azure, and Cloud SQL instances and configurations for Google Cloud. For self-managed databases, define database servers and configurations. Include instance specifications for compute and memory requirements, storage configurations for storage types and sizes, network settings for VPC and security groups, and backup configurations for retention and scheduling.

Terraform offers features beyond just deploying databases. It can manage database schemas, allowing you to version control database structures including table structures and relationships, index configurations for performance, constraint definitions for data integrity, and migration management for schema migration processes. Manage user permissions and access controls consistently by defining database users and roles, permission policies for access controls and privileges, connection security for SSL/TLS and encryption requirements, and network access for firewall rules and network policies.
