# Map your current workflows

Automating processes without understanding current workflows leads to automated chaos rather than efficiency. Mapping your current workflows identifies what tasks teams perform manually, where bottlenecks occur, and which processes create the most operational pain. This documentation creates a baseline for measuring improvement and ensures automated workflows address actual problems rather than theoretical ones.

Process mapping reveals inefficiencies that teams accept as normal, such as manual steps that could be eliminated, knowledge trapped in individual team members' experience, and failure points that lack proper error handling. Documenting these workflows before automation prevents implementing flawed processes at scale.

## Why map workflows

Workflow mapping addresses the following operational challenges:

- **Identify high-impact automation opportunities:** Without understanding which processes consume the most time or cause frequent failures, teams automate the wrong things first. Workflow mapping quantifies time spent, error rates, and business impact, allowing you to prioritize automation efforts that provide maximum value.

- **Prevent automating broken processes:** Automating a flawed manual process creates a fast, reliable way to produce incorrect results. Documenting current workflows reveals inefficiencies, unnecessary steps, and logical errors that you can fix before implementing automation.

- **Establish measurable baselines for improvement:** Claiming automation reduced deployment time from "a long time" to "faster" lacks credibility. Workflow documentation provides specific metrics like current deployment duration, failure rates, and resource requirements that demonstrate automation's impact.

- **Create institutional knowledge and reduce dependency on individuals:** When critical processes exist only in senior engineers' heads, vacations and departures create operational risk. Documented workflows transfer knowledge to the entire team and new hires.

## Document current processes

Start by identifying processes that are candidates for automation. Focus on workflows that teams perform frequently, that produce errors often, that consume significant time, or that block other work. Common candidates include infrastructure provisioning, application deployments, database operations, security compliance checks, and incident response procedures.

For each process, document what the process accomplishes and why it exists, who performs the process and what skills they need, when the process is triggered and how often it runs, and what constitutes successful completion. Create step-by-step documentation including specific actions taken, tools and systems used, decision points that require judgment, and handoffs between team members or systems.

Document operational details including permissions and access required, dependencies on other systems or processes, common failure scenarios and troubleshooting steps, and typical time required for each step. Include examples of actual executions, capturing screenshots or command outputs that show what success and failure look like.

## Identify pain points and prioritize

As you document workflows, identify problems like steps prone to human error, inconsistent execution across team members, lack of validation that work completed successfully, and missing error handling or rollback procedures. Look for inefficiencies such as manual steps that involve copying and pasting, redundant work across similar processes, bottlenecks where work waits for approvals or resources, and time spent on administrative tasks rather than delivering value.

Note knowledge gaps including processes that depend on specific individuals' experience, steps that lack documentation or have outdated instructions, tribal knowledge not captured in any system, and unclear success criteria or acceptance tests.

Prioritize automation candidates using impact, effort, and risk factors. Assess impact by measuring time the process currently consumes, criticality to business operations, and value automation would deliver. Evaluate effort by considering process complexity, available tools and systems, and team skills and capacity. Consider risk including consequences of process failures, required testing and validation, and potential impact of automation bugs.
