# Automate monitoring dashboards and alerts

Monitoring dashboard and alert configuration becomes challenging as your infrastructure scales across environments. Manual dashboard creation leads to inconsistent alerting thresholds, gaps in observability coverage, and configuration drift between development, staging, and production.

Monitoring-as-code (MaC) solves these operational challenges by automating dashboard and alert configuration with Terraform. You define monitoring configuration as code, version control all changes, and automatically provision dashboards when you deploy new infrastructure.

## Why use monitoring-as-code

Monitoring-as-code addresses the following operational challenges:

- **Remove configuration inconsistencies:** Manual dashboard creation leads to different monitoring setups across teams and environments. Configuration drift causes critical alerts to fire in one environment but remain silent in another, creating false confidence before deployments.

- **Reduce alert fatigue and monitoring gaps:** Teams that manually configure monitoring miss critical metrics or create redundant alerts. Monitoring-as-code standardizes alerting thresholds and ensures complete coverage across all services.

- **Maintain audit trails for compliance:** Manually configured monitoring lacks audit trails required by SOC 2, HIPAA, and other compliance frameworks. Monitoring-as-code provides version control for all changes, documenting who made modifications and when.

- **Scale monitoring with infrastructure growth:** As infrastructure grows, manually creating dashboards and alerts for each new service becomes unsustainable. Monitoring-as-code automatically provisions monitoring when you deploy new infrastructure.

## Adopt monitoring-as-code with an iterative workflow

Designing complex monitoring dashboards directly in code can be challenging when you first adopt monitoring-as-code. Use an iterative workflow that balances visual design with infrastructure-as-code benefits.

Use the following workflow to adopt monitoring-as-code without starting from scratch:

1. **Design in the UI:** Use your monitoring tool's interface to visually design dashboards and alerts. Configure metric queries, layout panels, and threshold values until the monitoring meets your needs.

1. **Export to code:** Export the dashboard configuration from the UI. Most monitoring tools provide JSON or YAML export functionality that contains your dashboard definition.

1. **Import to Terraform:** Create a Terraform configuration that includes your exported dashboard. Use the appropriate Terraform resource (like `aws_cloudwatch_dashboard` or `datadog_dashboard`) and paste your exported configuration.

1. **Create reusable modules:** Convert your Terraform configuration into a module with variables for team names, service names, and metric thresholds. The module becomes your organization's standard monitoring template.

1. **Deploy consistently:** Teams use your Terraform module to create consistent monitoring across all services. When you improve the module, all teams receive the updates by upgrading their module version.

The iterative workflow combines visual design tools with infrastructure-as-code consistency. After you build functional dashboards in the UI, Terraform ensures those dashboards deploy identically across all environments.

With monitoring-as-code (MaC), you can adopt the following best practices from infrastructure-as-code (IaC):

- **Maintain consistent configuration:** MaC lets you consistently deploy standardized monitoring setups across teams and environments. Terraform modules include standard monitoring configurations with built-in reasonable defaults. Monitoring tool vendors offer official Terraform providers that your organization can use.

- **Automate provisioning:** As your organization scales, infrastructure and service deployments automatically trigger monitoring dashboard creation. Every new microservice deployment includes complete observability without manual configuration.

- **Track auditable changes:** Version control tracks all changes to monitoring components, providing the audit trail that compliance frameworks require. Teams can review who modified alerting thresholds and when changes occurred.

- **Enforce policy-compliant resources:** Sentinel and Open Policy Agent (OPA) validate that monitoring resources meet your organization's security and compliance policies before Terraform creates them.

## Choose your monitoring approach

Your monitoring tool choice depends on your infrastructure and requirements. Choose between cloud-native monitoring tools provided by your cloud vendor or third-party vendor monitoring tools based on your specific needs.

**Use cloud-native monitoring tools when you:**
- Operate primarily within a single cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Want to minimize agent installation and maintenance overhead
- Need monitoring costs to stay within cloud provider budgets
- Prefer using existing IAM roles for monitoring access control

**Use vendor monitoring tools when you:**
- Operate across multiple cloud providers and need unified dashboards
- Need advanced analytics, anomaly detection, or ML-powered insights
- Want to avoid vendor lock-in with OpenTelemetry standardization
- Already use vendor tools for application monitoring and want infrastructure visibility
