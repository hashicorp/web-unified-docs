# Configure cloud provider monitoring tools

Organizations running infrastructure in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud need dashboards and alerts to monitor hundreds of resources across multiple regions and accounts. Manually creating monitoring configuration through cloud provider consoles becomes unsustainable as infrastructure scales, leading to gaps in observability where critical issues go undetected.

Cloud-native monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations provide metrics, logs, and alerting that integrate directly with your infrastructure. These tools collect basic infrastructure metrics without requiring agent installation, reducing operational overhead compared to third-party monitoring solutions.

Terraform providers for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud include resources for creating monitoring dashboards, metric alarms, and log groups. You define monitoring configuration as code alongside your infrastructure, ensuring monitoring deploys automatically when you provision new resources. Before configuring cloud-native monitoring with Terraform, understand [monitoring-as-code concepts](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/as-code/monitoring) and decide whether [cloud-native or vendor monitoring tools](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/monitor/dashboards-alerts) best fit your infrastructure.

## Why use cloud-native monitoring tools

Cloud-native monitoring tools address the following operational challenges:

- **Eliminate agent installation overhead:** Cloud-native monitoring integrates directly with your cloud provider's APIs, eliminating the need to install, configure, and maintain third-party monitoring agents across thousands of instances and containers.

- **Reduce monitoring costs:** Using your cloud provider's monitoring services often costs less than third-party tools because metrics never leave your cloud environment and you avoid additional agent licensing fees or data egress charges.

- **Simplify access control and security:** Cloud-native tools use your existing IAM policies and security configurations, reducing the attack surface compared to granting third-party vendors access to your infrastructure metrics and logs.

## How cloud-native monitoring works

Cloud-native monitoring tools integrate directly with your cloud provider through native APIs. When you deploy EC2 instances, Azure virtual machines, or Google Compute Engine instances with Terraform, CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations automatically begin collecting basic metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, and disk I/O.

Terraform providers for each cloud platform include resources for creating dashboards that visualize these metrics, metric alarms that trigger when thresholds exceed limits, and log groups that aggregate application and system logs. You define dashboard layouts, alerting thresholds, and log retention policies in Terraform code, ensuring consistent monitoring configuration across all environments.

For detailed application monitoring and custom metrics, you can deploy cloud provider agents using Terraform. CloudWatch agents, Azure Monitor agents, and Google Cloud Operations agents collect application-level metrics, custom business metrics, and detailed system telemetry that basic monitoring doesn't capture.

Cloud-native monitoring tools work best for single-cloud infrastructure. For multi-cloud environments requiring unified dashboards across AWS, Azure, and GCP, consider [vendor monitoring tools](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/monitor/dashboards-alerts/manage-vendor) instead.
