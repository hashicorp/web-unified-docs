# Manage cloud-native monitoring tools

Many cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer their own monitoring services, which can effectively monitor infrastructure metrics and application logs. With Terraform, you can use cloud provider resources and specific monitoring modules to deploy and manage your cloud-native monitoring infrastructure without installing additional monitoring agents.

HashiCorp resources:

  - AWS maintains the [AWS Integration and Automation (IA) Terraform modules](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/aws-ia) - the [`cloudwatch-log-group`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aws-ia/cloudwatch-log-group/aws/latest) module deploys and manages an AWS Cloudwatch log group along with the corresponding IAM permissions. The [Terraform AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) contains CloudWatch resources that Terraform can create and manage such as the [`aws_cloudwatch_dashboard`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudwatch_dashboard) resource. 
  - Azure maintains [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/terraform/tf-resource-modules/#available-modules) - the [avm-res-operationalinsights-workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-operationalinsights-workspace/azurerm/latest) module deploys and manages a Log Analytics Workspace with reasonable defaults. The [Azure Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) contains the resources you need to deploy monitoring for your application in Azure such as [`azurerm_portal_dashboard`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/portal_dashboard) and [`azurerm_monitor_metric_alert`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/monitor_metric_alert).  
  - Google maintains a [cloud operations module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-operations/google/latest) that manages Google Cloud's operations suite (Cloud Logging and Monitoring). The [Terraform Google Cloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs) page provides Google Cloud Monitoring resources that Terraform can create and manage such as the [`google_monitoring_dashboard`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/monitoring_dashboard) resource.
