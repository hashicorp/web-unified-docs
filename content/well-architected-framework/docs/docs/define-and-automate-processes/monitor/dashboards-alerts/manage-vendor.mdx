# Configure third-party monitoring tools

Organizations operating across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud need unified monitoring dashboards that aggregate metrics from all environments. Cloud-native monitoring tools require separate dashboards for each provider, forcing teams to switch between CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations to investigate issues. Vendor monitoring tools like DataDog, New Relic, Grafana, and Splunk solve this problem by providing a single pane of glass for multi-cloud infrastructure.

Terraform providers for DataDog, New Relic, Grafana, Splunk, and hundreds of other monitoring vendors let you automate dashboard and alert configuration. You define monitoring resources—dashboards, alerts, notification channels—in Terraform code and deploy them automatically with your infrastructure changes.

OpenTelemetry (OTel) provides standardized instrumentation that works with any monitoring backend. The OpenTelemetry collector gathers metrics, logs, and traces from your applications and sends them to multiple monitoring tools simultaneously. Using OpenTelemetry prevents vendor lock-in, allowing you to switch monitoring providers without changing your application code. Before deploying vendor monitoring tools with Terraform, understand [monitoring-as-code concepts](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/as-code/monitoring) and decide whether [vendor or cloud-native monitoring tools](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/monitor/dashboards-alerts) best fit your multi-cloud infrastructure.

## Why use vendor monitoring tools

Vendor monitoring tools address the following operational challenges:

- **Unify observability across multiple clouds:** Organizations running infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP need centralized monitoring. Vendor tools aggregate metrics, logs, and traces from all cloud providers into a single dashboard, eliminating context switching between cloud-specific monitoring consoles.

- **Access advanced analytics and ML capabilities:** Vendor monitoring platforms provide anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and automated root cause analysis that cloud-native tools don't offer. Machine learning algorithms detect unusual patterns and alert teams before issues impact users, reducing mean time to detection.

- **Reduce vendor lock-in with OpenTelemetry:** OpenTelemetry provides standardized instrumentation that works with any monitoring backend. You instrument applications once with OpenTelemetry, then use Terraform to control which vendor backends receive the data. Switching vendors requires changing collector configuration, not re-instrumenting every application.

## How vendor monitoring tools work

Vendor monitoring tools use agents or OpenTelemetry collectors to gather metrics, logs, and traces from your infrastructure and applications. Agents installed on virtual machines, containers, or Kubernetes clusters send telemetry data to the vendor's backend platform where you create dashboards, configure alerts, and perform analysis.

OpenTelemetry provides a vendor-neutral approach to observability. You instrument your applications using OpenTelemetry SDKs that generate metrics, logs, and traces in a standardized format. The OpenTelemetry collector receives this data and exports it to one or more monitoring backends simultaneously. You can send metrics to DataDog, traces to Honeycomb, and logs to Splunk from a single OpenTelemetry collector by configuring multiple exporters.

Terraform providers for monitoring vendors define resources for dashboards, monitors, notification channels, and integration configurations. You create Terraform configurations that provision monitoring resources automatically when you deploy infrastructure. When alert thresholds need adjustment or new dashboards are required, you update Terraform code and apply changes across all environments consistently.

Vendor monitoring tools provide cross-cloud visibility and advanced analytics. If your infrastructure operates primarily within a single cloud provider, [cloud-native monitoring tools](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/monitor/dashboards-alerts/manage-cloud-native) may be sufficient and more cost-effective.
