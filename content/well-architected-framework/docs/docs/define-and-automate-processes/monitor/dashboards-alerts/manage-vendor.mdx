# Manage vendor monitoring tools with Terraform

Terraform makes it easy to deploy and manage various vendor monitoring tools through official providers and modules. Terraform has over 200 partner and community providers for logging and monitoring — some popular ones include DataDog, New Relic, Grafana, and Splunk. With these providers, you can automatically provision the monitoring tool, and its resources like dashboard alerts.

Many monitoring vendors also contribute to OpenTelemetry (OTel). OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to generate and export telemetry data like metrics, traces, and logs from your applications. The OpenTelemetry agent collects this data from your applications. Instead of deploying separate agents for each vendor monitoring tool, you can configure the OTel agent to export data to multiple backends simultaneously. For example, you can send metrics to Datadog, traces to Honeycomb, and logs to Splunk from the same Otel agent.

With Terraform, you have a unified approach to manage and operate all different monitoring systems through a single, automated workflow defined in code. Terraform lets you define the exact configuration you want for everything — from the OpenTelemetry agents collecting data (Refer to GCE example in external resources) to backend monitoring tools like DataDog, New Relic, Grafana, and others.

  - The [Terraform Datadog provider](/terraform/tutorials/applications/datadog-provider) tutorial guides you through how to use Terraform to deploy an application in EKS and install the DataDog agent across the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Terraform Registry hosts over 200 [Logging and Monitoring](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers?category=logging-monitoring) partner and community providers. You should be able to find a provider to manage your monitoring tool of choice. This includes popular providers such as the [New Relic Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs) and [DataDog Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/DataDog/datadog/latest/docs).
