# Automate deployments

Automated deployments eliminate manual errors and provide predictable, repeatable processes for both applications and infrastructure. Automating deployments involves using infrastructure as code to provision infrastructure and deploying applications to container orchestrators or virtual machines with immutable infrastructure patterns.

When you automate deployments, you gain the following benefits:

**Use infrastructure as code:** Define all infrastructure configuration files in version control systems. [Infrastructure as code](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/as-code/infrastructure) enables peer review, change tracking, and the ability to roll back to previous states.

**Adopt immutable infrastructure:** Build images with your application already installed rather than configuring resources after deployment. [Immutable infrastructure](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/immutable-infrastructure) increases consistency between environments and simplifies troubleshooting.

**Promote deployment through environments:** Validate your automation in non-production environments before promoting to production. Use identical processes across all environments to catch issues early. Start with a [development environment](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/define/development-environment), then move to staging, and then production.

**Implement progressive deployments:** Deploy changes gradually with [zero-downtime strategies](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/deploy/zero-downtime-deployments) like blue-green or canary deployments to minimize risk and enable quick rollbacks.

## Automate infrastructure provisioning

Use Terraform to provision and manage your application infrastructure in a predictable, repeatable way. Terraform has over [4000 providers](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers), letting you deploy to any cloud provider or platform that has an API.

HCP Terraform manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment, securely stores your state files, and enables team collaboration. Key features include:

- Connect to your VCS provider for infrastructure development workflows
- Store modules in a private registry for code reuse
- Run tasks to integrate third-party services during deployment
- Granular access controls for team permissions
- Policy enforcement for configuration guardrails

## Automate application deployment

Your application deployment process depends on your packaging strategy. For virtual machines and containers, package your application in the image itself rather than installing it after deployment. This immutable infrastructure approach ensures you know exactly what's running and simplifies scaling.

For both virtual machines and containerized applications, you can use Terraform to manage deployments of the virtual machines and container orchestrators like Kubernetes or Nomad. Terraform provides a unified workflow for managing both application and infrastructure resources.

### Kubernetes deployment

Kubernetes automates the deployment and scaling of containerized workloads. The [Terraform Kubernetes provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest) lets you interact with the Kubernetes API to deploy and manage workloads. You can also deploy Helm packages with the [Helm Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs).

### Nomad deployment

Nomad orchestrates and manages workloads including containers, standalone binaries, and batch jobs. Use the [Terraform Nomad provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/nomad/latest) to manage workloads using infrastructure-as-code, or use [Nomad Pack](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack) for templating and package management.
