# Sense of ownership

Employees perform better when they clearly understand the "what" and "why" behind their roles within an organization. Knowing their responsibilities and why they matter to the company's mission helps them see the bigger picture. When employees understand how their tasks contribute to the company's overall success, they feel more valued and are likely to take greater ownership of their work.

The following are some of the ways you can help your employees have a sense of ownership:

- Giving recognition and appreciation can help employees know that leadership is paying attention to their work. You can improve this by giving regular feedback and awards and incentives.
- Involving employees in decision-making will give them a sense of ownership. They will feel more vested in the organization if the team considers their suggestions and opinions.
- Providing opportunities for growth, such as career paths, can help employees plan for their professional career, and give them a reason to stay at a company.
- Giving employees meaningful work that aligns with their skills and interests helps employees understand how their work contributes to the company's success and mission.
