# Recognition

Recognition isn't one-size-fits-all. It is important to understand each team member's preferred style of recognition. What motivates one person might discourage another. When recognition doesn't align with an employee's comfort zone or values, it can backfire and undermine the very engagement you're trying to build.

We recommend discussing your employees' recognition and reward preferences with them. You can provide them with options to make the process easier. The following are some examples of ways to give your employees recognition:

- Calling out an individual during a team meeting is a good way to let the team know about their success. Some people are okay with face-to-face recognition from others, but it can bring anxiety for others. Be aware of your team's preferences.
- A public message in the team's message channel is suitable if someone doesn't mind others knowing about their success, but doesn't want it to be face-to-face.
- Some people want leadership to recognize them, but don't want other team members to know they have been singled out for recognition.
- Team-based recognition is best suited for those who prefer collective recognition over individual recognition.
- Depending on your budget, monetary or gift rewards can be a good option for showing recognition. Some examples include a cash bonus, a gift card, or items from your company store, such as mugs or clothing featuring your company logo.
