to-do:
1. Tell the user to open the terminal in Bob for git cloneing
3. Open Bob, then select **File > Open Folder** and navigate to the `spring-framework-petclinic` directory. (this should happena the start)
4. You should see the project files in the explorer and the Bob chat panel on the side. If the chat panel is not visible, click the Bob icon beside the navigation bar to open it. (what is the short cut)
6. Figure out the nested error
7. Verify the modernized application (Do we want these to run in Bob or CLI? Or have Both? Bob handles it well and gives context)
8. Remove .git stuff
9. What do we want to do with the 6 issues?
10. Where do we want to send them in Next steps
11. The @pom.mxl only works sometimes. Gets a API Request Failed
- Seems to be a lot of API issues right now.



Questions:
1. How much do we want to explain which LLM model Bob uses? The docs basically say nothing about it, but we should treat it as a feature.




Pick back up on this tutorialL /Users/cjobermaier/workspace/web-unified-docs/content/well-architected-framework/docs/docs/define-and-automate-processes/bob/bob-get-started.md Remember, all the docs about bob are in sqm. This tutorial main focus is to teach people about Bob IDE and features. It uses a java application as the exmample. Review the tutorial and give me suggestions for improvement based on:
1. Is the content easy to follow
2. Can areas be more Bob focused?
