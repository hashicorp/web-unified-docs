- I need to write a tutorial
- Persona of the user of this tutorial
- The tutorial will be for developers who want to modernize legacy Java code
- You dont need to worry about installation. Have a section for that but I will handle it manually. 
- Skill level should be medium to advanced
- This tutorial will show how to use AI to modernize legacy Java code
- Have a section on install: we will link to here https://internal.bob.ibm.com/docs/ide/install
- There needs to be pre-reqs for the tutorial
- The tutorial will start with a simple java app that runs, but it uses legacy java code.
- Point out the legacy compotents to the user
- Go over what AI will change to modernize the code
- Each step will show the user what prompt to run to have AI modernize a component of the code
- Before starting on the steps, have the user create a project with AI and an AGENTS.md
- explain what each prompt did to the code
- the end result should be modern java code that the user can run
- For the java app:
n older tomcat based Spring app https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic

We'd want to checkout an older version of the app, maybe Java 8, and then moderinze it to Java 17 probably.
