# Detect leaked secrets across your organization

Leaked secrets in code repositories, documentation, and cloud storage pose critical security risks to your organization. A defense-in-depth strategy uses multiple layers of security controls to protect data rather than relying on any single protective measure.

## Why detect leaked secrets proactively

**Secrets leak continuously without detection:** Studies show secrets are committed to public GitHub repositories every 30 seconds on average. Without automated detection, organizations remain unaware of exposed credentials for days or weeks while attackers exploit them within hours of discovery.

**Manual secret discovery fails at scale:** Organizations with hundreds of repositories, documentation systems, and cloud storage locations cannot manually audit all locations where secrets might appear. The sheer volume of code commits, document updates, and configuration changes makes manual review impractical and error-prone.

**Leaked secrets create supply chain attack opportunities:** Attackers use automated tools to continuously scan public repositories for exposed credentials. Once discovered, these secrets provide entry points for supply chain attacks, data breaches, and ransomware campaigns that impact not only your organization but also your customers and partners.

**Compliance requires evidence of detection:** Regulations like SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR mandate that organizations implement controls to detect and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Security auditors require evidence that you actively monitor for leaked credentials and respond to incidents promptly.

Implementing automated secret detection across all organizational data sources, combined with clear incident response processes and blameless reporting culture, lets you discover and remediate leaked secrets before attackers exploit them. After [preventing leaked secrets through access controls](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/manage-leaked-secrets/prevent-leaked-secrets-access-controls) and [credential management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/manage-leaked-secrets/prevent-leaked-secrets-credential-management), detection provides the monitoring layer that identifies when secrets still leak despite preventive measures.

## Monitor critical data sources

To start building out your defense-in-depth strategy for leaked secrets, you should implement a solution to scan for and identify secrets across your organization's critical data sources. Each data source presents unique risks and requires specific scanning approaches.

Monitor the following common data source types:

- **Version control systems (VCS)** such as BitBucket, GitHub, or GitLab store your application source code and configuration files. Developers frequently commit API keys, database passwords, and cloud credentials directly into repositories. Once committed, secrets remain in Git history even after removal from current files, requiring specialized tools to detect and remediate historical exposure.

- **Documentation and communication systems** such as Confluence, Google Docs, or Slack contain operational runbooks, deployment guides, and troubleshooting documentation where teams often paste credentials for convenience. These systems typically lack the access controls and encryption that secrets management platforms provide, making them high-risk locations for secret exposure.

- **General storage locations** like local file systems and cloud storage such as Amazon S3 accumulate configuration files, backup scripts, and archived projects containing embedded secrets. Organizations often overlook these locations during security audits, allowing credentials to persist indefinitely in forgotten backups and legacy systems.

- **Local developer environments and CI/CD systems** including Docker containers, Kubernetes configurations, and Jenkins pipelines require credentials to deploy applications and access cloud resources. Developers frequently embed secrets in environment variables, configuration files, and container images that later get pushed to registries or shared with team members.

## Implement automated secret scanning

HCP Vault Radar scans your data sources for secrets and integrates with various providers to alert your teams when secrets are discovered. Vault Radar supports multiple scanning options to accommodate different workloads and data confidentiality requirements:

- **Cloud scanner** for publicly accessible systems such as GitHub, GitLab, and public cloud storage. The cloud scanner operates as a managed service, requiring no infrastructure deployment while continuously monitoring external repositories and services.

- **Vault Radar agent** for on-premises systems like self-hosted Confluence, internal documentation platforms, and private network resources. The agent deployment model ensures sensitive data never leaves your network while still providing centralized secret detection and reporting.

- **Vault Radar CLI** for integration with local developer environments, CI/CD pipelines, and custom workflows. Developer teams can incorporate secret scanning into pre-commit hooks, pull request validation, and deployment pipelines to catch secrets before they reach production systems.

Choose your deployment model based on data location and infrastructure:

- **Use the cloud scanner** when you need to monitor public repositories (GitHub, GitLab) and cloud storage without managing infrastructure.
- **Use the Vault Radar agent** when you need to scan on-premises systems, internal documentation platforms, or data that cannot leave your network.
- **Use the Vault Radar CLI** when you need to integrate scanning into developer workflows, pre-commit hooks, or CI/CD pipelines for shift-left security.

Vault Radar also prioritizes the severity of leaked secrets using pattern recognition and validation techniques. The system distinguishes between placeholder values (like "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"), example documentation text, and real credentials with active validity. This prioritization helps your security team focus remediation efforts on the highest-risk exposures first, reducing alert fatigue and improving response times. Once you detect leaked secrets, follow the [remediation process](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/manage-leaked-secrets/remediate-leaked-secrets) to rotate credentials and remove secrets from all locations.

## Foster a blameless reporting culture

Technical scanning and detection capabilities are ineffective when team members are afraid to report mistakes or potential security incidents. Creating a positive, blameless culture is essential. When people fear losing their jobs for admitting errors, they hide their mistakes rather than focus on fixing the underlying processes that allowed the incident to occur.

Organizations with blameless cultures see higher incident reporting rates and faster remediation times because team members feel safe admitting mistakes. This transparency lets security teams respond quickly before attackers exploit leaked secrets. Conversely, punitive cultures drive incidents underground where they fester undetected until external discovery forces a response.

The Google SRE book advises removing blame from the incident response process. This approach focuses on "identifying the contributing causes of the incident without indicting any individual or team for bad or inappropriate behavior." When someone leaks a secret, ask why the system allowed it rather than who made the mistake.

Build blameless secret detection with the following practical steps:

- Treat leaked secrets as learning opportunities that reveal process gaps
- Conduct post-incident reviews that focus on system improvements, not individual fault
- Publicly acknowledge and thank team members who report their own mistakes
- Automate secret detection so humans don't bear sole responsibility
- Document lessons learned and share them across teams to prevent similar incidents
