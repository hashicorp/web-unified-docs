# Implement zero trust security and networking

Zero trust security is a security model that eliminates the concept of trusted networks and requires verification for every user, device, and application attempting to access resources. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security, which assumes everything inside the network is safe, zero-trust security operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." 

In the following video, HashiCorp co-founder Armon Dadgar discusses the zero trust security model and how it can protect your organization.

## Next steps

In this section of Secure applications, you learned how zero trust security eliminates implicit trust by requiring verification for every access request and implementing identity-centric controls with network microsegmentation.
