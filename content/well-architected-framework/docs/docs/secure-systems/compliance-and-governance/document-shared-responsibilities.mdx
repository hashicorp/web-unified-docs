# Document shared responsibilities

Clear documentation of shared responsibilities prevents security gaps and compliance failures. When multiple teams or cloud providers share infrastructure ownership, undocumented boundaries create vulnerabilities and audit risks. This practice ensures everyone understands their security obligations and compliance requirements.

Shared responsibility models vary by cloud provider, deployment model, and organizational structure. Your documentation must reflect your specific environment while maintaining clarity for auditors and security teams.

## Define responsibility boundaries

Mapping your infrastructure components to ownership areas helps clarify who is responsible for what. In cloud environments, you need to distinguish between provider-managed services and customer-managed resources. Your documentation should cover who owns security for each layer, from physical infrastructure to application code.

Responsibility matrices work well for showing ownership of security controls, compliance requirements, and operational tasks. These matrices typically include specific team names, roles, and contact information for each responsibility area. You also want to define escalation paths for when responsibilities overlap or conflict.

Clear handoff points between teams and providers prevent gaps in security coverage. Your documentation should cover the specific security controls each party implements and how they coordinate during incidents or compliance audits. This includes defining who validates security configurations and who responds to security events.

## Implement accountability mechanisms

Regular review processes help validate that your documented responsibilities align with actual practices. Quarterly reviews with all stakeholders work well for updating responsibility matrices based on organizational changes or new compliance requirements.

Automated checks can verify that teams are fulfilling their documented responsibilities. Terraform Cloud's policy as code features help enforce security controls and generate audit trails of responsibility fulfillment. Dashboards that show compliance status across all responsibility areas become more effective when you integrate Vault's audit logging and Boundary's session tracking capabilities.

Clear communication channels for responsibility-related issues prevent confusion during critical moments. Your process should cover how teams coordinate during security incidents, compliance audits, or infrastructure changes. This includes documenting how to resolve responsibility conflicts or gaps when they arise.
