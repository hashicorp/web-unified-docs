# Audit trails

Organizations face increasing regulatory requirements to track who accessed what resources and when. Comprehensive audit trails provide visibility into system changes, user actions, and security events. When security incidents occur or compliance audits are required, detailed logs enable rapid investigation and demonstrate adherence to security policies. This practice ensures accountability and supports regulatory compliance across your infrastructure.

Audit trails must capture both automated system changes and manual user actions. Your logging strategy should provide sufficient detail for forensic analysis while maintaining performance and storage efficiency.

## Why audit trails

Implementing comprehensive audit trails addresses critical operational and compliance challenges:

**Demonstrate regulatory compliance:** Frameworks like SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI DSS require proof of who accessed what resources and when. Without detailed audit logs, organizations face compliance failures, failed audits, and potential fines. Audit trails provide the evidence auditors need to verify security controls.

**Enable rapid incident response:** When security breaches occur, investigation teams need to quickly determine what happened, which systems were affected, and what data was accessed. Without comprehensive logs, incident response becomes guesswork. Detailed audit trails enable forensic analysis and reduce mean time to resolution.

**Prevent and detect insider threats:** Malicious insiders and compromised accounts pose significant risks. Comprehensive logging deters unauthorized access by creating accountability and enables detection of suspicious patterns like unusual access times, bulk data downloads, or privilege escalation attempts.

**Support forensic analysis and root cause investigation:** System failures and security incidents require detailed investigation to prevent recurrence. Audit trails provide the timeline of events needed for root cause analysis, showing the sequence of changes that led to problems and enabling teams to implement preventive measures.

## Implement comprehensive logging

Identify all systems and services that require audit logging. Include infrastructure changes, application deployments, user authentication events, and data access patterns. Configure logging at multiple levels - infrastructure, application, and user activity.

After [establishing clear accountability boundaries](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/compliance-and-governance/document-shared-responsibilities), implement audit trails to track who fulfills their responsibilities and when. This connection between documented responsibilities and audit logs creates a complete accountability framework.

### Vault audit devices

Use HashiCorp Vault to generate detailed audit logs for all secrets management activities. Vault audit devices capture authentication attempts, secret access, policy changes, and administrative actions. Configure Vault to log to multiple destinations including files, syslog, or external logging services for redundancy and compliance.

The following example shows a Vault audit device configuration that logs to both file and syslog:

```hcl
# Enable file audit device
vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault/audit.log

# Enable syslog audit device for redundancy
vault audit enable syslog tag="vault" facility="AUTH"
```

This configuration creates redundant audit trails. The file backend provides detailed local logs for investigation, while syslog enables centralized log aggregation. Vault requires at least one audit device to be enabled and will block requests if all audit devices fail, ensuring no operations occur without logging.

### Terraform Cloud audit trails

Implement Terraform Cloud audit trails to track all infrastructure changes. Terraform Cloud provides detailed audit logs of plan and apply operations, including who initiated changes, what resources were modified, and when changes occurred. These logs are essential for compliance with infrastructure change management requirements and provide a complete history of infrastructure evolution.

### Consul service mesh logging

Configure Consul to log all service discovery and configuration changes. Consul Enterprise audit logging tracks service registration, health check updates, and configuration modifications. These logs help maintain visibility into service mesh changes and support compliance with service governance requirements.

## Centralize and analyze audit data

Establish a centralized logging infrastructure to collect audit data from all systems. Use log aggregation tools to normalize different log formats and create a unified view of system activity. Implement log retention policies that align with your compliance requirements and legal obligations.

Integrate [policy as code](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/compliance-and-governance/policy-as-code) with your audit logging to automatically validate that logging requirements are met. Sentinel policies can verify that audit devices are enabled and properly configured before infrastructure changes are applied.

### Boundary session tracking

Implement HashiCorp Boundary for comprehensive access audit trails. Boundary provides detailed session logs for all privileged access, including who accessed what resources, when sessions started and ended, and what commands were executed. Boundary's audit capabilities are essential for compliance with privileged access management requirements and provide complete visibility into user sessions across your infrastructure.

### Automated alerting

Create automated alerting for suspicious audit events. Set up monitoring for unusual access patterns, failed authentication attempts, or unauthorized configuration changes. Use log analysis tools to correlate events across different systems and identify potential security threats. Configure alerts to notify security teams immediately when critical events occur, enabling rapid response to potential incidents.
