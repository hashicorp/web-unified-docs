# Audit trails

Comprehensive audit trails provide visibility into system changes, user actions, and security events. When security incidents occur or compliance audits are required, detailed logs enable rapid investigation and demonstrate adherence to security policies. This practice ensures accountability and supports regulatory compliance across your infrastructure.

Audit trails must capture both automated system changes and manual user actions. Your logging strategy should provide sufficient detail for forensic analysis while maintaining performance and storage efficiency.

## Implement comprehensive logging

Start by identifying all systems and services that require audit logging. Include infrastructure changes, application deployments, user authentication events, and data access patterns. Configure logging at multiple levels - infrastructure, application, and user activity.

Use HashiCorp Vault to generate detailed audit logs for all secrets management activities. Vault's audit logging captures authentication attempts, secret access, policy changes, and administrative actions. Configure Vault to log to multiple destinations including files, syslog, or external logging services for redundancy and compliance.

Implement Terraform Cloud audit trails to track all infrastructure changes. Terraform Cloud provides detailed audit logs of plan and apply operations, including who initiated changes, what resources were modified, and when changes occurred. These logs are essential for compliance with infrastructure change management requirements.

## Centralize and analyze audit data

Establish a centralized logging infrastructure to collect audit data from all systems. Use log aggregation tools to normalize different log formats and create a unified view of system activity. Implement log retention policies that align with your compliance requirements and legal obligations.

Configure Consul to log all service discovery and configuration changes. Consul's audit logging tracks service registration, health check updates, and configuration modifications. These logs help maintain visibility into service mesh changes and support compliance with service governance requirements.

Implement HashiCorp Boundary for comprehensive access audit trails. Boundary provides detailed session logs for all privileged access, including who accessed what resources, when sessions started and ended, and what commands were executed. Boundary's audit capabilities are essential for compliance with privileged access management requirements and provide complete visibility into user sessions across your infrastructure.

Create automated alerting for suspicious audit events. Set up monitoring for unusual access patterns, failed authentication attempts, or unauthorized configuration changes. Use log analysis tools to correlate events across different systems and identify potential security threats.
