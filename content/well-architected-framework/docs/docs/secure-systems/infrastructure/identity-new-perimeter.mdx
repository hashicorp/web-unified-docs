# Identity in the new perimeter

Securing modern infrastructure requires a new approach to security. While many
security principles remain the same as legacy infrastructure, how
you implement these principles has changed. In legacy infrastructure, security
focused on securing the network perimeter using firewalls, VPNs, and other network
security tools. 

Modern infrastructure encompasses a mix of on-premises, cloud, and
software-as-a-service (SaaS) workloads. Securing modern infrastructure requires
a shift in focus to securing access to resources using identities, as the network
perimeter is no longer a reliable boundary.

Identity has become the new perimeter for securing modern infrastructure.
Instead of relying on network security tools to secure access to resources,
organizations must focus on securing user and machine identities. In addition to
shifting focus to identities, organizations must also ensure all services:

- Follow the principle of [least
  privilege](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege),
  granting the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
- Use [strong authentication and authorization
  mechanisms](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/implement-strong-sign-in-workflows),
  including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to access resources.
- Replace long-lived credentials with [ephemeral, short-lived
  credentials](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/use-dynamic-credentials)
  to reduce the risk of credential theft.
- Implement a [data classification
  scheme](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/classify-data) for all
  services. 
- Isolate workloads and resources to limit the effect of potential
  security breaches.
- Continuously monitor and audit access to resources to detect and respond to
  potential threats.

## Why you should use identity as a security perimeter

By adopting identity as the new perimeter, organizations can build a more secure
infrastructure that is better equipped to handle the challenges of modern
workloads.

Shifting security focus to identities provides several benefits:

- **Improved security**: By focusing on securing identities, organizations can
  better protect against threats such as phishing, credential theft, and
  insider threats.
- **Greater flexibility**: Identity-based security allows organizations to
  securely manage access to resources across a mix of on-premises, cloud, and
  SaaS workloads.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Identity-based security can provide a more
  seamless user experience, reducing the need for users to remember multiple
  passwords or navigate complex network security tools.
- **Better compliance**: Identity-based security can help organizations meet
  regulatory requirements by providing better visibility and control over
  access to sensitive data and resources.

HashiCorp Vault allows you to adopt ephemeral, dynamic credentials - replacing
long-lived credentials with short-lived ones to reduce the risk of credential
theft. Vault dynamic credentials support multiple cloud providers like Amazon Web
Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as
databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

HashiCorp Boundary provides identity-aware access without requiring
network-level trust. Instead of opening firewall ports or managing VPN
connections, Boundary verifies user identity and grants just-in-time access to
specific resources based on their authenticated identity and assigned
permissions.

You can further enhance your security posture by integrating Vault and Boundary
to allow identity based access to target resources. Users authenticate to
Boundary through a trusted identity provider, and Boundary retrieves dynamic
credentials from Vault to access the target resource.

HashiCorp Terraform enables you to manage identity [policies as
code](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/compliance-and-governance/policy-as-code),
ensuring consistent security configurations across all environments and making
your identity perimeter auditable and version-controlled.

## Next steps

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned why it is important to
shift to using identity as the new security perimeter. Focusing security
programs around identity allows you create a more comprehensive security
strategy. Identity as a security perimeter is part of the [Secure systems
pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
