# Manage network ingress and egress

As you transition to a security culture centered around identity, managing
traffic to and from your infrastructure, both cloud and self-managed, becomes a
critical component of security.

Traditional infrastructure relies on network-based controls to manage traffic
coming into (ingress), and out of (egress) your local network, or data center.
Small networks often used a flat network, and were only able to manage traffic
at the network perimeter. Larger networks or organizations with a more mature
security program create virtual networks (VLANs) to separate network
traffic. VLANs allow you to create internal network perimeters, and
deploy network access controls (NACL) to manage traffic. Security teams also
have the option to configure operating system firewalls to help manage traffic.
Managing local operating system firewalls is often difficult to manage at scale
and places additional overhead on each system to process traffic.

Modern infrastructure still relies on VLANs for network isolation, however
advances in networking services provide even greater control. Most modern
infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers allow you to filter both ingress
and egress traffic at the network interface (NIC) level, before it reaches
the operating system. Managing traffic at the NIC level is also known as
micro-segmentation, and is a key component as you build towards a zero trust
network architecture.

## Why manage network ingress and egress

Managing network ingress has been a standard security practice for decades.
Managing egress traffic, however, is often overlooked. Managing egress traffic
ensures that systems that do not require outbound network access are not able to
initiate connections to external systems. This helps prevent data exfiltration,
and limits the ability for attackers to communicate with command and control
servers.

While managing network ingress and egress is important, it can be resource
intensive to manage at scale. As you build a culture of security centered around
identity, you can begin to shift away from network-based controls, and focus on
identity-based security.

HashiCorp Consul allows you to connect infrastructure and services using a
service mesh. Consul protects communication using mutual TLS (mTLS) to ensure that only
authorized services are able to communicate with each other. 

- **Automatic mTLS encryption** for all service communication, eliminating the need for network-level encryption.
- **Service intentions** that act as application-aware firewall rules, allowing you to define which services can communicate based on identity rather than IP addresses.
- **Transparent proxy integration** that automatically routes and secures traffic without application code changes.
- **L7 traffic management** including traffic splitting, timeouts, and retries that reduce the need for complex network configurations.

By using Consul, you shift from managing network ports and IP-based ACL rules to
managing identities and communication policies.

Consul service intentions allow you to manage which services communicate with each
other. For example, you can write an intention that blocks traffic for a specific
infrastructure component, or service:

```hcl
Kind = "service-intentions"
Name = "backend"
Sources = [
  {
    Name = "frontend"
    Action = "deny"
  }
]
```

HashiCorp Boundary allows you to limit network ingress by providing secure,
identity-based access to infrastructure without opening network ports or
managing VPN connections. Boundary verifies user identity and grants just-in-time
access to specific resources based on their authenticated identity and assigned
permissions.

- **Credential-less access** that removes the need to distribute SSH keys or manage VPN certificates.
- **Just-in-time network access** that creates temporary, session-based connections rather than permanent network paths.
- **Multi-hop architecture** that allows secure access to private networks without exposing internal network topology.
- **Session recording and monitoring** that provides complete audit trails without network packet inspection.
- **Integration with identity providers** that ties network access decisions to your existing user directory.

For infrastructure not well integrated with a service mesh, you can use
HashiCorp Terraform to manage network policies. Terraform enables you to manage
network ingress and egress rules as code, ensuring consistent security
configurations across all environments and making your network policies
auditable and version-controlled.

- **Standardizing security group configurations** across multiple cloud providers and environments.
- **Implementing least-privilege network policies** through code review and approval processes.
- **Automating security group updates** based on application deployment patterns.
- **Providing drift detection** to identify when network configurations have been manually modified.
- **Enabling policy-as-code** where network security rules are tested and versioned like application code.

In this example Terraform configuration, you create an AWS security group with
no defined network egress. Using Terraform to create the security group removes
the default egress rule that normally allows all outbound traffic.

```hcl
# By omitting egress rules, this security group blocks all outbound traffic
# (removes AWS default "allow all" egress rule)

resource "aws_security_group" "no_egress_sg" {
  name        = "no-egress-security-group"
  description = "Security group that blocks all outbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  # Ingress rules
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["192.168.1.0/24"] # Allow SSH from specific CIDR
    description = "Allow SSH inbound"
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/24"] # Allow HTTP from specific CIDR
    description = "Allow HTTP inbound"
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "no-egress-security-group"
  }
  }
  ```

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned why it is important to
secure network ingress and egress traffic. Unmanaged traffic creates risks for
your companies security programs, leading to leaked secrets, or unauthorized
access to data. Manage network ingress and egress is
part of the [Secure systems pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
