Following these documents in order ensures a logical progression through the key
concepts and best practices, helping you build a strong foundation to build a
culture of security in your organization.

- [Identity is the new perimeter](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/infrastructure/identity-new-perimeter)
- [Build a culture of security automation](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/infrastructure/build-culture-security) **(this document)**
- [Build a zero trust network architecture](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/infrastructure/build-zero-trust-network)
- [Secure human access to infrastructure](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/infrastructure/secure-access)
- [Prevent lateral movement](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/infrastructure/prevent-lateral-movement)
- [Automate security compliance and governance](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/infrastructure/automate-security-compliance)

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned why it is important to
shift to using identity as the new security perimeter. Focusing security
programs around identity allows you create a more comprehensive security
strategy. Identity as a security perimeter is part of the [Secure systems
pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
