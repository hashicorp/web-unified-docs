# Build a zero trust network

In the secure infrastructure series, you learned about the importance of
shifting your security focus to identities, instead of the traditional network
perimeter. You have also learned how to incorporate security into your
organizations culture, enabling security automation to improve efficiency and
reduce human error. You then read about the importance of
managing ingress and egress (north-south) traffic and preventing lateral
movement to stop unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

The foundational concepts you have learned so far provide one approach to
building a zero trust network architecture. 

## What is a zero trust network architecture?

A zero trust network architecture is a security model that
eliminates implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request,
regardless of its origin.

In a zero trust model, all users and devices are treated as untrusted
until they are verified. In a zero trust environment, access to resources is
granted based on strict identity verification and least privilege principles.

When the HashiCorp tools discussed throughout this series work together, they
create a strong security model across your infrastructure.

1. **Terraform manages infrastructure changes:**

   - Engineers modify infrastructure through code review.
   - [CI/CD](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/automate/cicd)
     systems use Vault-generated cloud credentials.
   - No human has direct cloud console access.

1. **Vault manages secrets and identities:**

   - Manages static and dynamic secrets.
   - Creates a trusted identity platform to authenticate and authorize users and
     devices.
   - Issues just-in-time credentials for infrastructure access.
   - Manages certificates for both PKI and certificate-based authentication.

1. **Boundary and Vault provide access to infrastructure:**

   - Support teams access infrastructure through Boundary.
   - Vault provides just-in-time credentials for each session.
   - All access is temporary, audited, and automatically expires.

1. **Consul enables network security:**

   - API gateways and ingress controllers manage north-south traffic with identity-based policies.
   - Service mesh provides automatic mTLS encryption and service-to-service authorization.
   - Service intentions define which services can communicate, providing
     micro-segmentation that blocks unauthorized lateral movement.

1. **Waypoint allows developer self-service:**

   - Developers deploy through standardized workflows without infrastructure access.
   - Platform teams define secure deployment patterns that developers automatically follow.
   - Reduces the number of people requiring direct infrastructure permissions.

Combining these tools creates a strong foundation for a zero-trust model where
access to infrastructure is both secure and auditable without sacrificing
operational efficiency.

Other services to complete your zero trust architecture include:

- **Identity providers** - Centralized [identity and access management
  systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/define-access-requirements)
  (Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity) that integrate with Vault to provide SSO and
  MFA capabilities.
- **SIEM solutions** - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  solutions (Splunk, ELK Stack, Grafana) that collect and analyze logs
  from Vault, Boundary, Consul, and other systems to provide real-time
  monitoring and alerting.
- **Endpoint security solutions** - Tools that ensure devices accessing the
  network meet security standards, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and
  endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned about the tools and
workflows needed to build a zero trust network architecture. Integrating
HashiCorp tools into your zero trust network architecture enables auditable
infrastructure changes, secure access to infrastructure following the principle
of least privilege, and properly managed secrets. Build a zero trust network is part of the [Secure systems
pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
