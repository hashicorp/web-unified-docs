# Build a zero trust network

In the secure infrastructure series, you learned about the importance of
shifting your security focus to identities, instead of the traditional network
perimeter. You have also learned how to incorporate security into your
organizations culture, enabling security automation to improve efficiency and
reduce human error. In the last document, you learned about the importance of
filtering both ingress and egress traffic to prevent unauthorized access and data
exfiltration.

The foundational concepts you have learned so far set you up to build a zero trust
network architecture. A zero trust network architecture is a security model that
eliminates implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request,
regardless of its origin.



When all three tools work together, they create a comprehensive security model:

1. **Infrastructure Changes (Terraform):**
   - Engineers modify infrastructure through code review
   - CI/CD systems use Vault-generated cloud credentials
   - No human has direct cloud console access

2. **Operational Access (Boundary + Vault):**
   - Support teams access infrastructure through Boundary
   - Vault provides just-in-time credentials for each session
   - All access is temporary, audited, and automatically expires

3. **Zero Standing Privileges:**
   - No long-lived credentials anywhere in the system
   - No permanent access to infrastructure resources
   - Every action is authenticated, authorized, and audited

This creates a true zero-trust model where human access to infrastructure is
both secure and auditable without sacrificing operational efficiency.

concepts and best practices, helping you build a strong foundation to build a
culture of security in your organization.

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned why it is important to
shift to using identity as the new security perimeter. Focusing security
programs around identity allows you create a more comprehensive security
strategy. Identity as a security perimeter is part of the [Secure systems
pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
