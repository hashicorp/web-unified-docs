# Prevent lateral movement

This guide describes one of the foundational approaches to safeguard and protect against 
“bad actors” following the well documented [MITRE ATT&CK
framework](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/attack_matrix_poster_2024_april.pdf)
(lateral movement).

## Lateral movement techniques

Lateral movement is the act of moving through the environment from a compromised
resource into an uncompromised one by exploiting the assumption that the former
is secure. The following diagram shows the lateral movement techniques attackers
commonly use to compromise systems through unauthorized means.

Common techniques include:

- Exploitation of remote services
- Internal spear phishing
- Lateral tool transfer
- Remote service session hijacking
- Remote services
- Replication through removable media
- Software deployment tools
- Taint shared content
- Use alternate authentication material

With various techniques available to anyone, you need to protect your
organization with a solution that stops lateral movement through bi-directional
or mutual transport layer security or (mTLS).

## Secure cloud native applications

In the traditional datacenter approach to network security, network
administrators segment the network into different virtual networks (VLANs).
You apply rules to each VLAN to allow access between services in different
VLANs. Following this model, however, might allow a compromised system in one
VLAN to access services in other VLANs without proper authentication and
authorization.

In modern applications that use a cloud native approach, dynamic (or ephemeral)
services come up and down often. These services need to establish secure
connections and not rely on long-lived secrets or manual authentication processes.

## Implement a service mesh

With the rise of cloud native practices, organizations need to ensure they have
secure, resilient, and performant applications while reducing complexity at
scale.

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages communication
between services for distributed applications. Rather than
embedding networking logic directly into application code, the service mesh
abstracts these concerns into a separate layer. This allows services to
communicate through the mesh infrastructure without needing to understand the
underlying network.

The benefits of a service mesh include enhanced observability, security,
and reliability. It provides load balancing, traffic routing, and failure
handling without requiring code changes. Security is strengthened through
automatic mutual TLS encryption and policy enforcement. This separation of
concerns allows development teams to focus on business logic while the service
mesh handles operational concerns like retries, timeouts, circuit
breaking, and canary deployments, ultimately reducing complexity and improving
the maintainability of large-scale distributed systems.

HashiCorp's service mesh solution, Consul, enables practitioners to achieve this
today by leveraging mTLS between services in the mesh.

## Enable secrets management

Running a service mesh introduces its own set of challenges. Organizations need
to secure, and manage the service mesh configuration and supporting resources.
An example of some of these resources in a mesh are:

- Server TLS credentials
- Service mesh client TLS credentials
- Access control list (ACL) bootstrap token
- ACL partition token
- ACL replication token
- Enterprise license
- Gossip encryption key
- Snapshot agent configuration

If you're using a service mesh today you should consider the level of effort to 
store the secrets associated with the service mesh.

Centralization of secrets across your environments are essential to stop a
lateral attack among other vulnerabilities. Identity is the new perimeter and
identity is a secret. Managing multiple secrets may lead to secret sprawl.

HashiCorp Vault can help practitioners simplify these workloads and centralize
these secrets.  Vault's secrets engines give teams solutions for various
use cases trying to manage secrets.
