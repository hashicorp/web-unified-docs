# Protect sensitive data 

Sensitive data includes personally identifiable information, financial records, passwords, and confidential business information that could cause harm if accessed by unauthorized parties. After [classifying your data](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/classify-data), implement security controls for confidential and restricted information throughout its entire lifecycle.

## Why protect sensitive data

**Prevent data breaches and identity theft:** Malicious actors constantly target organizations to steal sensitive information. Without comprehensive protection throughout the data lifecycle, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities during creation, storage, transmission, backup, or deletion phases.

**Maintain security through all lifecycle phases:** Organizations focus on protecting data in use or in transit but often neglect data during storage, backup, archival, and deletion. Each lifecycle phase presents unique vulnerabilities that require specific security controls to prevent unauthorized access.

**Detect and prevent secret leaks:** Developers accidentally commit secrets to version control, documentation systems, and project management tools. These exposed credentials enable attackers to access production systems, databases, and cloud infrastructure without triggering traditional security alerts.

## Data lifecycle protection

Common phases of a data lifecycle management framework include the following:

- **Create (including data acquisition):** Establish secure data generation processes, implementing proper validation and sanitization procedures, and ensuring you classify data appropriately from the moment of creation or ingestion.

- **Store:** Implement secure storage with appropriate access controls, encryption at rest, and regular security assessments of storage infrastructure and configurations.

- **Use and share:** Enforce strict access controls, monitor data usage patterns, implement secure sharing protocols, and maintain audit trails of all data interactions.

- **Archive (including backup):** Ensure long-term storage security through encrypted backups, regular restoration testing, and maintain access controls even for archived data.

- **Delete:** Implement secure deletion procedures that ensure data is completely removed from all systems, including backups and temporary files.

## Protect sensitive data with HashiCorp tools

Defense-in-depth requires protecting data during transmission and storage. [Encrypt data in transit](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/protect-data-in-transit) using TLS for client-server communication and mTLS for service-to-service communication. [Encrypt data at rest](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/protect-data-at-rest) by securing both the data itself and the underlying storage systems.

Vault's Transit secrets engine provides encryption as a service for data in transit without storing the data. Vault Enterprise's Transform secrets engine supports NIST-vetted format-preserving encryption (FPE) for sensitive data requiring specific output formats. For detailed guidance on protecting highly sensitive data like credit card numbers, see [tokenize data](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/tokenize-data).

HCP Vault Radar scans data sources including Azure DevOps, GitHub, Confluence, and Jira to detect accidentally exposed secrets in version control, documentation, and project management systems. Vault Radar identifies leaked credentials before attackers discover them.

Consul encrypts service-to-service traffic using mutual TLS (mTLS) within the service mesh. Legacy applications gain mTLS protection through Consul proxies without code changes, enabling comprehensive encryption across your infrastructure.

## Next steps

In this section of how to Secure data, you learned how to protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle using classification, encryption at rest, encryption in transit, and secret scanning. Implement these layered security controls to prevent data breaches and maintain comprehensive protection from creation through deletion. Protect sensitive data is part of the [Secure systems pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
