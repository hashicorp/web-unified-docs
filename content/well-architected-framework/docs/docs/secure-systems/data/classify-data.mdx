# Classify data

Data classification organizes information into categories based on sensitivity levels. Organizations classify all data types, including digital files and printed materials, to protect confidential information and meet compliance requirements. A basic data classification scheme might include the following:

- **Public:** Information that is freely available and can be shared with anyone. Public data is commonly website or contact information, marketing material, press releases, or other product and service information such as public SOC-2 reports.

- **Internal:** Information that can generally be shared internally with all employees such as internal policies. Documents marked as internal include benefit information, general project plans, or product and service information not meant for public disclosure.

- **Confidential:** Confidential information is restricted and could cause damage to the organization if disclosed, such as detailed network information, financial information, customer lists, detailed SOC-2 runbooks, or upcoming business plans that have not yet been finalized and shared with the broader organization (at which point it would be considered internal).

- **Restricted:** Restricted information can cause severe damage to the organization, its employees, or customers if compromised. Restricted information might include system credentials or API keys, pending patent applications, merger and acquisition plans, or sensitive customer related information such as credit card, or patient information.

## Why classify data

**Meet compliance requirements:** Organizations in healthcare, financial services, and other regulated industries must classify data to comply with HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, ISO, and NIST frameworks. Without classification, you cannot demonstrate compliance or implement appropriate security controls.

**Control access to sensitive information:** Employees need clear guidance on what information they can share publicly, with clients, under NDAs, or not at all. Data classification provides this framework, reducing the risk of accidental disclosure.

**Implement appropriate security controls:** Different data types require different protection levels. Classifying data lets you apply encryption, access controls, and monitoring proportional to the risk, optimizing security resources without over-protecting low-sensitivity data.

After classifying your data into sensitivity levels, [protect sensitive data](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/protect-sensitive-data) throughout its lifecycle. HashiCorp Vault lets you store restricted data such as credentials or API keys and manage access using ACL or Sentinel policies. You can also [encrypt data at rest](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/protect-data-at-rest) and [encrypt data in transit](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/protect-data-in-transit) with Vault.

HashiCorp Boundary manages access to internal systems by ensuring only authorized users can connect. When you integrate Vault with Boundary, Vault dynamically generates and inserts credentials into the authentication process, eliminating the need to share static credentials. 

Both Boundary and Vault are available as self-hosted applications or through the [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in).

## Next steps

In this section of how to Secure data, you learned how to classify organizational data into sensitivity categories and why classification is essential for compliance and security. After classifying your data, protect it throughout its lifecycle by encrypting data at rest, encrypting data in transit, and using tokenization for highly sensitive values. Classify data is part of the [Secure systems pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
