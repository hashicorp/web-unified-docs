# Classify data

Data classification is a foundational security practice that organizes data into sensitivity levels based on the potential impact of unauthorized access. Data classification covers all types of data, including digital and printed material. Organizations should classify all data based on sensitivity to ensure appropriate security controls and access restrictions. A basic data classification scheme includes the following levels:

- **Public:** Information that is freely available and can be shared with anyone. Public data includes website content, contact information, marketing material, press releases, and product information such as public SOC-2 reports.

- **Internal:** Information that can be shared internally with all employees such as internal policies, benefit information, general project plans, and product information not meant for public disclosure.

- **Confidential:** Information that is restricted and could cause damage to the organization if disclosed. Confidential data includes detailed network information, financial information, customer lists, detailed SOC-2 runbooks, and business plans not yet finalized.

- **Restricted:** Information that can cause severe damage to the organization, employees, or customers if compromised. Restricted information includes system credentials, API keys, pending patent applications, merger and acquisition plans, credit card information, and patient data.

## Why should you classify data?

Data classification addresses critical security and compliance challenges that organizations face when managing sensitive information:

**Regulatory compliance risk:** Organizations operating in healthcare, financial services, or other regulated industries face penalties and legal consequences without proper data classification. Compliance frameworks like HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, ISO, and NIST require documented data classification schemes to demonstrate security controls.

**Data breach exposure:** Unclassified data increases the risk of unauthorized access because security teams cannot prioritize protection efforts. Data breaches involving sensitive information result in financial losses, reputational damage, and customer trust erosion.

**Inefficient security controls:** Without classification, security teams apply uniform controls to all data, wasting resources on low-value data while under-protecting sensitive information. Classification enables risk-based security that focuses resources where they matter most.

**Audit and compliance gaps:** Organizations cannot demonstrate compliance or respond to audit requests without documented data classification. Classification provides the foundation for access controls, encryption policies, and audit trails that regulators require.

## How to implement data classification

Implementing data classification requires defining classification levels, applying them to existing data, and integrating classification with security tools and workflows.

### Define your classification scheme

Start by defining classification levels that match your organization's risk tolerance and regulatory requirements. The four-level scheme such as public, internal, confidential, and restricted, works for most organizations, but you may need additional levels or different names based on industry requirements.

Document clear criteria for each classification level, including:
- Types of data that belong in each category
- Potential impact if data is compromised
- Required security controls for each level
- Access restrictions and approval processes

### Apply classification to data

Apply classification labels to data at creation time and review existing data to assign appropriate classifications. Classification should be:
- **Documented:** Record classification decisions and criteria
- **Consistent:** Apply the same standards across all data types
- **Reviewed:** Periodically review classifications as data sensitivity changes
- **Automated:** Use tools to detect and classify sensitive data patterns

### Integrate with HashiCorp tools

HashiCorp Vault and Boundary help you enforce data classification through access controls and secrets management.

**Vault for classified data protection:**

Vault stores restricted data securely such as credentials and API keys, and manages access using access control list (ACL) policies that map to classification levels. You can create separate Vault paths for each classification level and apply policies that restrict access based on user roles and data sensitivity.

For example, create Vault policies that enforce classification-based access:

```hcl
# Restricted data access policy - senior engineers only
path "secret/restricted/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

# Confidential data access policy - team members
path "secret/confidential/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

# Internal data access policy - all employees
path "secret/internal/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

The Vault policy maps to your organization's classification scheme, ensuring only authorized users access data at each sensitivity level. Vault's audit logging records all access attempts, providing the audit trail that compliance frameworks require.

Vault also encrypts application data using the transit secrets engine, though Vault does not store the encrypted data. Use Vault's encryption capabilities to protect confidential and restricted data throughout its lifecycle.

**Boundary for infrastructure access:**

Boundary manages access to internal systems by ensuring only authorized users connect to systems that process classified data. When you integrate Vault with Boundary, Vault dynamically generates and inserts credentials into the authentication process, eliminating the need to share long-lived credentials for accessing systems with classified data.

Configure Boundary targets and roles that map to data classification levels, ensuring users only access infrastructure appropriate for their clearance level.

Both Boundary and Vault are available as self-hosted applications. However, you can get started with them quickly using the [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in).

**HCP Vault Radar for data discovery:**

HCP Vault Radar scans connected data sources such as Azure DevOps, GitHub, Confluence, and Jira to identify secrets and sensitive data in version control, documentation, and project management tools. Use Vault Radar to discover unclassified sensitive data and ensure proper classification and protection.
