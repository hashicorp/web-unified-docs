# Securely store secrets for CI/CD pipelines

CI/CD pipelines automate software delivery by building, testing, and deploying applications. These automated workflows require access to sensitive credentials including API keys, database passwords, cloud provider credentials, TLS certificates, and SSH keys. CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps provide built-in secrets storage, but these native solutions create secret sprawl across tools and environments. Teams duplicate credentials across multiple systems, making rotation difficult and increasing the attack surface.

Centralized secrets management with HashiCorp Vault solves these challenges by providing a single source of truth for all CI/CD secrets. Vault integrates with major CI/CD platforms through native authentication methods like OIDC and JWT, removing the need for long-lived static credentials. With centralized secrets management, you gain visibility into secret access patterns through comprehensive audit logs, and benefit from automated credential rotation and dynamic secret generation.

## Why secure CI/CD secrets with Vault

Securing secrets in CI/CD pipelines addresses the following security and operational challenges that organizations face when automating infrastructure and software delivery:

**Remove secrets in pipeline logs:** CI/CD platforms log pipeline execution for debugging, but these logs often capture secrets in plain text when commands echo credentials or API responses include sensitive data. Vault's dynamic secrets and secure retrieval methods prevent credentials from appearing in build logs, protecting against accidental exposure through log aggregation systems.

**Prevent secret sprawl:** CI/CD workflows span multiple stages such as build, test, and deploy, along with multiple environments like dev, staging, and production. Multiple stages and environments require teams to duplicate secrets. Vault centralizes secret storage so pipelines retrieve credentials on-demand, removing the need to copy secrets across multiple CI/CD configurations and reducing the attack surface.

**Automate credential rotation:** When credentials expire or require rotation for security compliance, teams must manually update secrets in every CI/CD platform, repository, and environment configuration. Vault's dynamic secrets and automated rotation enable credential updates without modifying pipeline code while reducing deployment delays.

**Audit secret access for compliance:** Security teams need visibility into which pipelines access which secrets, when access occurred, and whether access patterns indicate compromise or policy violations. Vault's audit logging tracks every secret request with pipeline identity, timestamp, and accessed paths, providing the audit trail required for SOC 2, PCI DSS, and other compliance frameworks.

[HashiCorp Vault](/vault/) provides centralized secrets management to help secure your CI/CD workflows. Vault can manage identities and authentication with JWT/OIDC, LDAP, TLS certificates, tokens, and usernames and passwords. You can also use Vault to authenticate your CI/CD workloads with major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. This range of support lets you build flexible workflows and choose how your CI/CD pipelines retrieve data.

The following diagram shows how Vault integrates with CI/CD platforms to provide centralized secrets management:

## Compare CI/CD platform integrations

Each CI/CD platform has a recommended authentication method and integration approach for Vault. Use the following table to compare platforms and choose the approach that fits your environment:

| Platform | Auth method | Dynamic secrets | Native integration | Setup complexity |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [GitHub Actions](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/github-actions) | OIDC | Yes | Vault Action | Low |
| [GitLab](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/gitlab) | JWT/OIDC | Yes | Built-in | Low |
| [Jenkins](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/jenkins) | AppRole/JWT/LDAP | Yes | Vault Plugin | Medium |
| [CircleCI](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/circle-ci) | OIDC | Yes | CLI | Low |
| [TeamCity](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/teamcity) | AppRole/LDAP | Yes | Vault Connection | Medium |
| [Azure DevOps](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/azure-devops) | JWT/OIDC | Yes | CLI | Medium |
| [Bitbucket Pipelines](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/bitbucket) | OIDC | Yes | CLI | Low |
| [Argo CD](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/argo-cd) | Kubernetes | Yes | Vault Secrets Operator | Medium |
| [Terraform](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/terraform) | OIDC | Yes | Native OIDC | Low |

All platforms support both static and dynamic secrets through Vault. Platforms with OIDC support provide the strongest authentication security because they eliminate long-lived credentials entirely. The table shows recommended authentication methods. Review the platform-specific guides for complete authentication options and detailed integration instructions.

## Security best practices

Apply the following practices across all CI/CD platform integrations to strengthen your secrets management posture:

- **Use dynamic secrets over static when possible:** Dynamic secrets are generated on-demand and expire automatically, reducing the attack surface.
- **Enforce least-privilege Vault policies:** Grant each CI/CD pipeline access only to the specific secrets it needs.
- **Enable audit logging:** Maintain a complete record of all secret access for compliance and security investigations.
- **Use OIDC/JWT authentication over static tokens:** Token-based authentication with OIDC eliminates long-lived credentials and provides fine-grained access control.
- **Rotate static secrets on a schedule:** For secrets that cannot be dynamically generated, implement automated rotation policies.
- **Avoid common anti-patterns:** Review insecure practices and eliminate them from your pipelines.

## Next steps

In this overview of managing CI/CD secrets, you learned that CI/CD pipelines require secure access to sensitive data, such as API keys and credentials, and that you should use a centralized secrets store like HashiCorp Vault. Managing CI/CD secrets is part of the [Secure systems pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).

Learn about [dynamic and static secrets in CI/CD](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/dynamic-and-static-secrets) to understand when to use short-lived dynamic credentials versus static secrets with rotation.
