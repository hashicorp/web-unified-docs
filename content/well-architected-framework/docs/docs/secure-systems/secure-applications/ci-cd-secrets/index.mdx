# Securely store secrets for CI/CD pipelines

CI/CD pipelines require secure access to sensitive data like API keys, credentials, and certificates. Manually managing these secrets creates security risks and operational overhead.  You should use a centralized secrets store to manage your secrets. 

This collection provides guidance and resources for securing popular CI/CD platforms with Vault, and highlights common authentication and secrets management anti-patterns.

[HashiCorp Vault](/vault/) enables centralized secrets management to help secure your CI/CD workflows. Vault can manage identities and authentication with JWT/OIDC, LDAP, TLS certificates, tokens, and usernames & passwords. You can also use Vault to authenticate your CI/CD workloads with major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. This range of support enables you to build flexible workflows, and choose how your CI/CD pipelines retrieve data.
