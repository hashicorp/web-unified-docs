# Securely store secrets for CI/CD pipelines

CI/CD pipelines require secure access to sensitive data like API keys, credentials, and certificates. Manually managing these secrets creates security risks and operational overhead. You should use a centralized secrets store to manage your secrets.

## Why

Managing secrets in CI/CD pipelines presents significant challenges for organizations:

**Security breaches from exposed credentials:** Hard-coded secrets in CI/CD configurations or source code repositories create attack vectors that can lead to data breaches, unauthorized system access, and compromised production environments.

**Operational overhead from decentralized management:** Without centralized secrets management, teams must manually update credentials across multiple CI/CD systems, repositories, and environments, leading to human error and security gaps.

**Compliance requirements:** Regulatory frameworks like SOC 2, PCI DSS, and HIPAA require demonstrable secrets management controls including automatic rotation, comprehensive audit logging, and least-privilege access policies.

**Lack of secret lifecycle management:** Static secrets without expiration or rotation policies remain valid indefinitely, providing attackers unlimited time to discover and exploit compromised credentials.

Centralized secrets management with HashiCorp Vault addresses these challenges by providing a single source of truth for secrets, enabling dynamic credential generation, supporting automatic rotation, and maintaining comprehensive audit trails.

This collection provides guidance and resources for securing popular CI/CD platforms with Vault, and highlights common authentication and secrets management anti-patterns.

[HashiCorp Vault](/vault/) provides centralized secrets management to help secure your CI/CD workflows. Vault can manage identities and authentication with JWT/OIDC, LDAP, TLS certificates, tokens, and usernames & passwords. You can also use Vault to authenticate your CI/CD workloads with major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. This range of support lets you build flexible workflows, and choose how your CI/CD pipelines retrieve data.

## Compare CI/CD platform integrations

Each CI/CD platform has a recommended authentication method and integration approach for Vault. Use the following table to compare platforms and choose the approach that fits your environment:

| Platform | Auth method | Dynamic secrets | Native integration | Setup complexity |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [GitHub Actions](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/github-actions) | OIDC | Yes | Vault Action | Low |
| [GitLab](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/gitlab) | JWT/OIDC | Yes | Built-in | Low |
| [Jenkins](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/jenkins) | AppRole/JWT | Yes | Vault Plugin | Medium |
| [CircleCI](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/circle-ci) | OIDC | Yes | CLI | Low |
| [TeamCity](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/teamcity) | AppRole/LDAP | Yes | Vault Connection | Medium |
| [Azure DevOps](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/azure-devops) | JWT/OIDC | Yes | CLI | Medium |
| [Bitbucket Pipelines](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/bitbucket) | OIDC | Yes | CLI | Low |
| [Argo CD](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/argo-cd) | Kubernetes | Yes | VSO | Medium |

All platforms support both static and dynamic secrets through Vault. Platforms with OIDC support provide the strongest authentication security because they eliminate long-lived credentials entirely. Review the platform-specific guides for detailed integration instructions.

## Security best practices

Apply the following practices across all CI/CD platform integrations to strengthen your secrets management posture:

- **Use dynamic secrets over static when possible:** Dynamic secrets are generated on-demand and expire automatically, reducing the attack surface. Learn about [dynamic and static secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/dynamic-and-static-secrets) to choose the right approach.
- **Enforce least-privilege Vault policies:** Grant each CI/CD pipeline access only to the specific secrets it needs. Read the [Vault policies documentation](/vault/docs/concepts/policies) for policy configuration guidance.
- **Enable audit logging:** Maintain a complete record of all secret access for compliance and security investigations. Configure at least one [Vault audit device](/vault/docs/audit) in production.
- **Use OIDC/JWT authentication over static tokens:** Token-based authentication with OIDC eliminates long-lived credentials and provides fine-grained access control. Learn about the [JWT/OIDC auth method](/vault/docs/auth/jwt) for pipeline authentication.
- **Rotate static secrets on a schedule:** For secrets that cannot be dynamically generated, implement automated rotation policies. Configure [schedule-based static role rotation](/vault/docs/secrets/databases#schedule-based-static-role-rotation) for supported engines.
- **Avoid common anti-patterns:** Review [CI/CD secrets anti-patterns](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications/ci-cd-secrets/anti-patterns) to identify and eliminate insecure practices in your pipelines.
