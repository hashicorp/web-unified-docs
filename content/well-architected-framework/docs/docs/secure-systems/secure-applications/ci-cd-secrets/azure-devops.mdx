description: Integrate Azure DevOps Pipelines with HashiCorp Vault using JWT/OIDC or managed identity authentication. Retrieve secrets with detailed audit trails.

# Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps Pipelines can authenticate with Vault to securely retrieve secrets for CI/CD workflows. Instead of storing credentials in Azure DevOps variable groups or pipeline variables, pipelines authenticate to Vault at runtime and retrieve secrets on demand.

## Why integrate Azure DevOps with Vault

Integrating Azure DevOps with Vault addresses the following critical security and operational challenges in pipeline automation:

**Eliminate secret sprawl across projects:** Vault centralizes secret storage so pipelines retrieve credentials on-demand from a single source, reducing the need to duplicate secrets across multiple Azure DevOps projects, variable groups, and service connections. Centralized storage simplifies rotation and reduces the risk of exposure.

**Enable automatic credential rotation:** Vault automates credential rotation and distributes updated credentials without requiring pipeline configuration changes, reducing operational overhead and maintaining security posture.

**Meet compliance and audit requirements:** Vault provides comprehensive audit logs that track every secret access with pipeline identity and timestamp, supporting regulatory compliance frameworks like SOC 2, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.

**Provide dynamic credentials:** Vault generates temporary credentials for each pipeline run that automatically expire, limiting the exposure window if credentials leak through logs, error messages, or compromised pipeline agents.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Azure DevOps with Vault, you need the following:

- A Vault instance or HCP Vault accessible from Azure DevOps pipeline agents over the network
- Azure DevOps project with administrator access to configure pipelines and variable groups
- A Vault authentication method configured
- Vault policies that grant Azure DevOps the necessary read permissions for your secrets
- We recommend TLS encryption between Azure DevOps agents and Vault

## Choose an integration approach

Azure DevOps supports several approaches for integrating with Vault. Choose one of the following approach that matches your security requirements and Azure infrastructure:

| Approach | Setup Complexity | Security Posture | Azure AD Dependency | Agent Types Supported |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| AppRole | Low | Good | None | All (Microsoft-hosted, self-hosted) |
| JWT/OIDC with Azure AD | Medium-High | Excellent | Required | All with Azure AD service connections |
| Azure Managed Identity | Medium | Excellent | Required | Self-hosted on Azure VMs only |

- **AppRole authentication:** Install Vault CLI on pipeline agents and authenticate using the [AppRole auth method](/vault/docs/auth/approle). AppRole works reliably with Azure DevOps Pipelines, requires minimal Azure AD configuration, and supports all agent types including Microsoft-hosted and self-hosted. Store the Role ID and Secret ID in Azure DevOps variable groups with secret masking enabled. AppRole requires managing two credentials (Role ID and Secret ID) but provides straightforward setup.

- **JWT/OIDC authentication with Azure AD:** For Azure DevOps service connections with workload identity federation, authenticate to Vault through Azure AD service principals using the [JWT/OIDC auth method](/vault/docs/auth/jwt). JWT/OIDC auth method approach requires configuring Azure AD application registrations and service connections, but removes the need to manage Role IDs and Secret IDs in variable groups. OIDC authentication requires additional Azure AD setup and is more complex than AppRole, but provides the strongest security posture by eliminating long-lived credentials entirely. Use this approach when you need Azure AD-based identity for compliance or when integrating with other Azure AD-protected resources.

- **Azure managed identity with Vault Azure auth:** For self-hosted pipeline agents running on Azure VMs, use the [Vault Azure auth method](/vault/docs/auth/azure) to authenticate with Azure managed identities. Vault validates the Azure AD JWT token and grants access based on subscription, resource group, and VM identity. Managed identities eliminate credential management entirely but require Azure VM infrastructure. Use this approach when you run self-hosted agents on Azure infrastructure and want to leverage Azure's native identity management.

## Integration pattern

Azure DevOps pipelines authenticate to Vault, retrieve secrets, and set them as masked pipeline variables for use in deployment tasks:

1. **Authenticate:** Pipeline uses AppRole credentials, stored in variable groups, Azure AD OIDC tokens, or Azure managed identities to authenticate to Vault
1. **Retrieve secrets:** Pipeline calls Vault API to retrieve static secrets from KV engine or dynamic credentials from secrets engines
1. **Use secrets:** Vault secrets are set as Azure DevOps pipeline variables with secret masking enabled and used in subsequent deployment tasks

The following example shows a minimal AppRole authentication pattern for Azure DevOps pipelines:

```yaml
steps:
  - task: Bash@3
    displayName: 'Retrieve secrets from Vault'
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Authenticate to Vault with AppRole
        export VAULT_ADDR="https://vault.example.com:8200"
        export VAULT_TOKEN=$(vault write -field=token auth/approle/login \
          role_id=$(VAULT_ROLE_ID) \
          secret_id=$(VAULT_SECRET_ID))
        
        # Retrieve database password from Vault
        export DB_PASSWORD=$(vault kv get -field=password secret/database/production)
        
        # Set as masked pipeline variable for use in subsequent tasks
        echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=DB_PASSWORD;issecret=true]$DB_PASSWORD"
```

The pipeline authenticates to Vault using AppRole credentials stored in Azure DevOps variable groups, retrieves a database password from Vault's KV secrets engine, and sets it as a masked pipeline variable. Subsequent deployment tasks can reference the `DB_PASSWORD` variable securely.
