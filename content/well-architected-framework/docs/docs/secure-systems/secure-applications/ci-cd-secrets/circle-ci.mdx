# CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) uses [OIDC tokens](https://circleci.com/docs/openid-connect-tokens) to authenticate with Vault.
Vault [supports OIDC](/vault/docs/auth/jwt) and
has a lab to help practitioners learn Vault's [OIDC Auth Method](/vault/tutorials/auth-methods/oidc-auth).
We recommend practitioners complete the lab before setting up CircleCI Vault integration.

- Rosemary Wang (Developer Advocate, HashiCorp) pairs with Angel Rivera (Developer Advocate, CircleCI) to inject static secrets from HashiCorp Vault into a CircleCI pipeline in their [HashiTalks video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6lG7FR5_Ow).
  - Video Resources:
    - [Code examples](https://github.com/punkdata/nodejs-circleci/tree/vault) from the video
