# Bitbucket Pipelines

Bitbucket Pipelines supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens that provide secure authentication to Vault without storing long-lived credentials. When you use OIDC authentication, Bitbucket generates a short-lived identity token for each pipeline step that Vault can verify using the [JWT auth method](/vault/docs/auth/jwt) and use to grant access to secrets.

## Why integrate Bitbucket Pipelines with Vault

Integrating Bitbucket Pipelines with Vault addresses the following security and operational challenges in pipeline automation:

**Eliminate secret sprawl:** Teams often duplicate secrets across multiple Bitbucket repositories, deployment environments, and workspace-level variables, making rotation difficult and increasing the risk of exposure if a single repository is compromised. Vault centralizes secret storage so pipelines retrieve credentials on-demand from a single source.

**Enhance repository variable protection:** Bitbucket's built-in repository and deployment variables provide basic secret storage with masking in logs, but lack advanced features like automatic rotation, dynamic secret generation, and centralized policy management across multiple Bitbucket workspaces. Vault provides secret management with automated rotation and policy enforcement.

**Meet compliance and audit requirements:** Organizations need detailed audit trails showing which pipelines accessed which secrets and when, but Bitbucket's native logging may not provide the granularity required for regulatory compliance frameworks like SOC 2, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. Vault provides comprehensive audit logs that track every secret access with pipeline identity and timestamp.

**Enable dynamic credential support:** Static secrets stored in Bitbucket variables remain valid indefinitely, creating a larger attack surface compared to short-lived dynamic credentials that expire automatically. Vault generates temporary credentials for each pipeline run that automatically expire, minimizing exposure windows.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Bitbucket Pipelines with Vault, you need the following:

- A Vault instance or HCP Vault accessible from Bitbucket Pipelines over the network
- Bitbucket workspace with administrator access to configure pipelines and repository settings
- A Vault JWT auth method configured to trust Bitbucket's OIDC issuer
- Vault policies that grant Bitbucket Pipelines the necessary read permissions for your secrets
- We recommend TLS encryption between Bitbucket Pipelines and Vault

## Integration pattern

Bitbucket Pipelines authenticates to Vault using native OIDC tokens generated for each pipeline step:

1. **Enable OIDC:** Configure pipeline step with `oidc: true` to enable Bitbucket OIDC token generation for that step
2. **Authenticate:** Pipeline uses the automatically generated `$BITBUCKET_STEP_OIDC_TOKEN` to authenticate to Vault using the JWT auth method
3. **Retrieve secrets:** Pipeline calls Vault API to retrieve secrets from KV engine or dynamic credentials from secrets engines
4. **Use in deployment:** Secrets are available as environment variables in pipeline scripts

The following example shows a minimal OIDC authentication pattern for Bitbucket Pipelines:

```yaml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Deploy with Vault secrets
        oidc: true
        script:
          # Authenticate to Vault with OIDC token
          - export VAULT_ADDR="https://vault.example.com:8200"
          - export VAULT_TOKEN=$(vault write -field=token auth/jwt/login role=bitbucket-role jwt=$BITBUCKET_STEP_OIDC_TOKEN)

          # Retrieve database password from Vault
          - export DB_PASSWORD=$(vault kv get -field=password secret/database/production)

          # Use secret in deployment
          - ./deploy.sh
```

The pipeline enables OIDC for the step, authenticates to Vault using the Bitbucket-generated OIDC token, retrieves a database password from Vault's KV secrets engine, and uses it in deployment. The OIDC token is automatically generated for each pipeline run and requires no manual credential management.
