# Build a certificate authority (CA)

Certificate authorities (CAs) play a crucial role in X.509 by issuing trusted certificates and maintaining a repository of certificates. CAs help you verify and authenticate identities across networks.

One of a security operator's responsibilities is managing those digital certificates. HashiCorp Vault provides features to ease the burden of certificate lifecycle management through automation. Vault offers a central place to secure and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. Dynamic secrets provide credentials to third party services which match your password policies for complexity and lifecycle. Vault can also manage the revocation and rotation of secrets for you. Vault dynamic secrets extend to X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates, where Vault acts as a root or intermediate CA to manage the lifecycle of short-lived certificates. The Vault PKI secrets engine enables your applications to generate managed certificates on-demand. Vault also supports a rich set of functionality around TLS certificates, including Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME), and Certificate Issuance External Policy Services (CIEPS).

## Next steps

In this section of [Secure applications](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secure-applications), you learned how Vault acts as a root or intermediate CA to manage the lifecycle of short-lived certificates. Secure applications is part of the [Secure systems pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).
