# Use dynamic credentials

Strong identity and access management practices are critical to building a
secure environment. While some credentials must always be available, others can
be dynamic and short-lived, reducing the risk of exposure while enhancing your
security posture.

## What are dynamic credentials

Dynamic credentials are temporary, short-lived credentials generated on demand
and automatically expire after a specified period. The credentials are typically
used in scenarios where long-lived credentials are not necessary or pose a
security risk.

## Why use dynamic credentials

You can generate dynamic credentials for various services, applications,
and users, allowing them to authenticate without exposing their long-term credentials.
Using dynamic credentials minimizes the attack surface and reduces the likelihood of
credential theft or misuse.

When a service needs to connect to another service, such as a database, it
requires some method to authenticate. Traditionally, you might use a username
and password or an API token. When these credentials are available for an
extended period, there is a greater potential for them to become compromised.

HashiCorp Vault supports generating dynamic credentials for various cloud
providers and other systems. For example, Vault can generate dynamic
credentials using a supported secrets engine for Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and
database services like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL.

Many of the secrets engines supported by Vault allow you to manage static
credentials as well. You onboard the static account to Vault, allowing Vault to
manage the lifecycle of the password for that account when dynamic
credentials are not supported.

Vault dynamic secrets also integrate with other HashiCorp tools and services
like Boundary, allowing you to provide secure access to developers without ever
having to share or expose the credentials.

HCP Terraform integrates with Vault allowing Terraform to generate dynamic
credentials during a deployment. Configuring Terraform to request dynamic
credentials from Vault allows you to avoid managing static credentials separately.

long-lived, static credentials with temporary credentials helps improve security.
