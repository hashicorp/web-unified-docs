# Use dynamic credentials for secure authentication

Long-lived credentials create security vulnerabilities in 
your infrastructure. Dynamic credentials minimize this problem 
by generating temporary access tokens on demand.

## What are dynamic credentials

Dynamic credentials are temporary, short-lived credentials generated on demand
and automatically expire after a specified period. The credentials are typically
used in scenarios where long-lived credentials are not necessary or pose a
security risk.

## Reduce credential exposure

You can generate dynamic credentials for various services, applications,
and users, allowing them to authenticate without exposing their long-term credentials.
Using dynamic credentials minimizes the attack surface and reduces the likelihood of
credential theft or misuse.

When a service needs to connect to another service, such as a database, it
requires some method to authenticate. Traditionally, you might use a username
and password or an API token. When these credentials are available for an
extended period, there is a greater potential for them to become compromised.

## Create dynamic credentials with Vault

Vault creates dynamic credentials across multiple platforms, removing the need for long-lived static credentials in your infrastructure. Vault integrates with major cloud providers, container orchestration platforms, and database systems through its secrets engines.

The following are some of the Vault secret engines that support dynamic
credentials:

- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL

Many of the secrets engines Vault supports allow you to manage static
credentials as well. You onboard the static account to Vault, allowing Vault to
manage the lifecycle of the password for that account when dynamic
credentials are not supported.

Vault dynamic secrets also integrate with other HashiCorp tools and services
like Boundary, allowing you to provide secure access to developers without ever
having to share or expose the credentials.

HCP Terraform integrates with Vault allowing Terraform to generate dynamic
credentials during a deployment. Configuring Terraform to request dynamic
credentials from Vault allows you to avoid managing static credentials separately.
