# Implement strong sign-in workflows

Implementing strong sign-in workflows is essential to protect your systems and
data. Strong sign-in workflows help ensure that only authorized users can access
your systems, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security
breaches.

## What are strong sign-in workflows

Strong sign-in workflows involve a combination of techniques and technologies to
verify a user's identity before granting access to systems. Strong sign-in
workflows typically consist of **something you know** - such as a password,
**something you have** - like a hardware token or smart card, and **something
you are** - such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Strong sign-in
workflows include:

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Combination of one or more sign-in factors
  to verify a user's identity.
- **Biometric authentication**: Use of unique biological traits, such as
  fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify a user's identity.
- **Adaptive authentication**: Contextual authentication that adjusts the level
  of verification based on user behavior and risk factors.

## Why implement strong sign-in workflows

Writing policies that follow [least
privilege](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege)
ensures that an authorized user does not have access to systems or data they
should not have access to. It does not, however, ensure that unauthorized users
have not improperly gained access to credentials that allow authentication to
those systems or data.

When you implement strong sign-in workflows, you add another layer of security
by validating the identity of users before granting access. When you combine
strong sign-in workflows with [centralized identity 
management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management),
you have an authentication model that ensures authorized users have access to systems.

HashiCorp tools and services like the HashiCorp Cloud Platform, Vault, and
HCP Terraform support both centralized identity management and strong sign-in
workflows using multi-factor authentication. Other tools like Nomad and Boundary
support multi-factor authentication through integration with third party identity
providers like Okta.

HashiCorp Consul service mesh allows you to securely connect services across
multiple runtime platforms. Consul supports mutual Transport Layer Security
(mTLS) authentication, which provides strong service-to-service authentication
within the service mesh.

In this section of **Identity and access management** you learned why you should
use strong sign-in workflows in conjunction with [centralized identity
management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management)
and policies that follow the [principle of least
privilege](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege).
Identity and access management is part of the [Secure
systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems) pillar.
