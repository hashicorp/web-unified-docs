# Centralize identity management

Designing and planning policies to manage access is part of a complete identity
and access management strategy. A key part of that strategy is to centralize
identity management, allowing you to enforce those policies effectively.

There are several ways to grant access to systems. Most systems have built-in
identity solutions that allow you to create local users and groups. Those users
and groups only have access to that specific system. While isolated identity
management may seem secure, it does not scale well and may introduce more
security risks than centralizing identity management.

## What is centralized identity management

Centralizing identity management allows you to manage access to all systems
from a single location. Solutions like LDAP, Active Directory, or cloud identity
providers like Okta, Azure EntraID, or Google Cloud Identity provide a way to
centralize identity management. After you centralize authentication, you then
integrate the identity provider with other systems and authorize access for those
users. Each user has a single username and password, but can access the systems
required to perform their job.

Having individual user accounts on multiple platforms is similar to having a
local user on your laptop. You can log in to the laptop with the local user, but
that username and password do not provide access to your email or other systems.

## Why centralize identity management

When you manage your users through a centralized
identity provider, you can enforce strong security policies like multi-factor
authentication (MFA), password complexity, and rotation policies. 

From an end user perspective, centralizing identity management provides a
single sign-on (SSO) experience, allowing users to access the systems they need
with a single set of credentials. Using SSO reduces the risk of password
fatigue and improves security by reducing the number of passwords that users
need to remember.

You can deploy HashiCorp Vault to support centralized identity management by:

- **Act as an OIDC provider** - Deploy Vault as an OIDC provider gives you
  complete control over your identity management workflow and allows you to
  expose the OIDC provider based on your security requirements.
- **Generate credentials** - Generate dynamic, short-lived credentials that
  eliminate static passwords stored in different systems.

Boundary provides identity-aware proxying to infrastructure without exposing
credentials to end users: 

- **Integrate with identity providers** - Connect Boundary to OIDC providers or
  Active Directory to authenticate users based on their existing corporate
  identities.
- **Role-based access control** - Map users and groups from your identity
  provider to Boundary roles, controlling which systems each user can access.
- **Session recording and auditing** - Track which users accessed which systems,
  creating an audit trail tied to real identities rather than shared
  credentials.

Most HashiCorp tools and services like the [HashiCorp Cloud
Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in), HCP Terraform, Boundary,
and Vault integrate with third party identity providers natively or through
OIDC allowing you to manage access to these tools from your centralized identity
provider.
