# Build secure access control policies for your organization

Writing IAM policies requires translating your organization's access 
requirements into enforceable permission guardrails. These policies 
enforce permissions guardrails by using [least
privilege](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege)
policies.

Creating policies and enforcing guardrails is the process of translating
requirements into policies that define what users, applications, and systems can
do. Writing effective permissions involves converting the requirements for each
role or function within your organization when you [defined your access
requirements](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/define-access-requirements)
into policies for your systems.

## Define permissions for users and systems

Permissions are the specific actions that users, applications, or systems can
take on resources. Organizations typically define permissions in policies and use them to
control access to resources in a system.

You can grant or deny permissions based on various factors, including the user's
role, group membership, the resources they access, and the context of the access
request. For example, a user may have permission to read data from a database
but not to write data to it.

Defining guardrails allows you to enforce policies at different levels of the
organization, preventing you from granting excessive permissions to
a user or system. This diagram shows an example of restricting permissions at
various levels. The effective permissions for a user is a combination of
permissions granted at the user, group, and organizational levels.

The following is an example of a database permission and AWS S3 bucket policy
that follows least privilege:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The PostgreSQL role `readonly_user` with the `SELECT` permission can select data from
tables, but not write or modify data.

An example AWS IAM policy that follows least privilege allows read-only access
to download files from the "company-reports" S3 bucket.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::company-reports",
                "arn:aws:s3:::company-reports/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Define permissions as code

Where possible, define your permissions as policy as code. Defining
permissions in policies, such as IAM, as code allows you to use version control,
track changes over time, and collaborate with your team. You can then use tools like
HashiCorp's Terraform or Red Hat's Ansible to deploy and update your policies.
Most systems support writing policies in JSON, YAML, or XML.

Watch the following video about policy as code to learn implementation strategies:

Some systems like HashiCorp's Vault and Sentinel support policies in custom languages like
the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). JSON is another widely supported
format. HashiCorp Vault supports JSON based policies, in addition to HCL. AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) supports JSON-based policies. Other systems
like Active Directory may require scripting the policies in other languages like
PowerShell to create Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

Terraform helps you manage your policies for supported tools and services,
allowing you to define, update, and enforce policies as code. Using automation
to manage policies ensures that your policies are consistent, auditable, and can
be version controlled.
