# What is HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework?

The Well-Architected Framework provides best practices for using HashiCorp products to enable your cloud and on-premises environments. These best practices will help you define and automate your processes, optimize your resources and costs, design reliable systems, and secure your infrastructure and services.

The framework is designed to help organizations implement a cloud operating model that aligns with their business goals and technical requirements.

The cloud operating model provides the fundamental approach to industrialize the application delivery process across each layer of the cloud: embracing the cloud operating model, and tuning people, processes, and tools to it. HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework enables practitioners to implement the cloud operating model's approach through sets of best practices organized under pillars. 

## Framework pillars

HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework is comprised of pillars. Each pillar contains groupings of best practices. Below is an overview of each pillar. 

### Automate and define processes

Establish repeatable, scalable workflows that reduce manual effort and human error while enabling teams to deliver infrastructure and applications consistently.

### Optimize resources

Maximize efficiency and minimize waste by right-sizing infrastructure, managing costs, monitoring performance, and implementing dynamic scaling strategies that align with actual usage patterns.

### Design resilient systems

Build fault-tolerant architectures that maintain availability and performance during failures through redundancy, disaster recovery planning, zero-downtime deployments, and robust networking strategies.

### Secure systems

Implement security controls including identity and access management, data protection, secrets management, and network security to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information.
