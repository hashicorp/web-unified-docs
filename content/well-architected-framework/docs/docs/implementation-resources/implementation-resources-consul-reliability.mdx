# Run a reliable Consul cluster

This document outlines implementation resources for maintaining a reliable Consul cluster. When you implement proper reliability measures, you ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and consistent performance of your Consul infrastructure.

The following sections cover architecture, monitoring, resource management, recovery, and resilience.

## Architecture

Learn about Consul Community Edition and Enterprise architecture and best practices for building reliable Consul clusters.

- Improving a Consul [cluster resilience](/consul/docs/concept/reliability)
- Recommendations for operating [Consul clusters at scale](/consul/docs/manage/scale)

## Monitoring

Monitor Consul to collect telemetry data to view performance, audits, and infrastructure usage to ensure Consul is reliable.   

- Monitor [service-to-service communication with Envoy](/consul/docs/observe/grafana/service-to-service)
- Monitor [Raft metrics and logs for WAL](/consul/docs/deploy/server/wal/monitor-raft)
- Monitor [Consul components](/consul/docs/monitor)
- [Monitoring and alerts recommendations for Consul](/consul/docs/monitor/alerts)
- Monitor [key metrics for Consul agent telemetry](/consul/docs/monitor/telemetry/agent)

## Resource management

Efficiently manage your Consul infrastructure, scaling, and performance.

- Optimize Consul [server performance](/consul/docs/reference/architecture/server) for overall throughput and health.
- Collect metrics with Consul [Dataplane Telemetry](/consul/docs/reference/dataplane/telemetry).
- Learn about [capacity planning recommendations](/consul/docs/reference/architecture/capacity) when deploying and maintaining a Consul cluster in production.
- Monitor [Raft metrics and logs for WAL](/consul/docs/deploy/server/wal/monitor-raft).

## Recovery

Recover Consul in the case of cluster degradation through the use of regular backups.

- [General considerations for Consul disaster recovery](/consul/tutorials/operate-consul/disaster-recovery)
- [Disaster recovery for Consul clusters](/consul/tutorials/operate-consul/recovery-outage)
- [Disaster recovery for federated primary Consul datacenter](/consul/tutorials/operate-consul/recovery-outage-primary)
- [Disaster recovery for Consul on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/production-kubernetes/kubernetes-disaster-recovery)
- [Disaster recovery for Consul on multi-cluster deployments](/consul/tutorials/production-multi-cluster/multi-disaster-recovery)

## Resilience

Run a resilient Consul cluster to avoid application downtime.

- Understand [fault tolerance in Consul clusters](/consul/docs/concept/reliability)
- Provide [fault-tolerance with Consul Redundancy Zones](/consul/docs/manage/scale/redundancy-zone)
- [Failover configuration overview](/consul/docs/manage-traffic/failover)
- Gain insight into service mesh events and errors with [Consul proxy access logs](/consul/tutorials/observe-your-network/proxy-access-logs)

## Next steps

In this document, you learned about the HashiCorp resources for implementing and running a reliable Consul cluster. The following are implementation guides on the other HashiCorp products.

- [Vault implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-vault-reliability)
- [Nomad implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-nomad-reliability)
- [Packer implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-packer-reliability)
- [Terraform implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-terraform-reliability)
