# Run a reliable Vault cluster

This document outlines implementation resources for maintaining a reliable Vault cluster. When you implement proper reliability measures, you ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and consistent performance of your Vault infrastructure.

The following sections cover architecture, monitoring, resource management, recovery, and resilience.

## Architecture

Learn about Vault Community Edition and Enterprise architecture and best practices for building reliable Vault clusters.

- Vault [reference architecture](/vault/docs/internals/architecture).
- Implement a robust [Vault Enterprise cluster](/vault/docs/enterprise/cluster-design).
- Follow [recommended patterns](/vault/docs/internals/recommended-patterns) to keep your Vault cluster operating reliably.

## Monitoring

Monitor Vault to collect telemetry data to view performance, audits, and infrastructure usage to ensure Vault is reliable.   

- [Telemetry metrics overview](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry/metrics) to learn about three types of telemetry metrics: counter, gauge, and summary.
- [Monitor common Vault metrics](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry/key-metrics) such as core, usage, storage backend, audit, and resource.
- Use the [Vault usage metrics dashboard](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count/usage-metrics) in the Vault UI to filter usage metrics by namespace or auth methods.
- [Enable Vault telemetry gathering](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry/enable-telemetry) to collect [telemetry data](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry) from your Vault cluster.
- Use [audit devices](/vault/docs/audit) to collect a detailed log of all requests to Vault and their responses.

## Resource management

Efficiently manage your Vault infrastructure, scaling, and performance.

- Enforce resource limits with [Vault resource quotas](/vault/docs/concepts/resource-quotas) and [lease count quotas](/vault/docs/enterprise/lease-count-quotas).
- [Prevent lease explosions](/vault/docs/configuration/prevent-lease-explosions) in your Vault cluster.
- [Benchmark and measure Vault performance](/vault/tutorials/operations/benchmark-vault) in environments that resemble production use cases to produce realistic results.
- Use [Vault Enterprise Adaptive overload protection](/vault/docs/concepts/adaptive-overload-protection) to prevent client requests from overwhelming different server resources.

## Recovery

Recover Vault in the case of cluster degradation through the use of regular backups.

- Use the [`-recovery` flag](/vault/docs/concepts/recovery-mode) to bring Vault up in recovery mode.
- Configure [Vault Enterprise to take regular backups](/vault/docs/enterprise/automated-integrated-storage-snapshots).
- [Vault Enterprise performance replication](/vault/docs/enterprise/replication) provides consistency, scalability, and highly-available disaster recovery.


## Resilience

Run a resilient Vault cluster to avoid application downtime.

- Run Vault in high availability (HA) mode to protect against outages by running multiple Vault servers. 
  - [High availability](/vault/docs/internals/high-availability)
  - [High availability mode (HA)](/vault/docs/concepts/ha)
- Run [performance standby nodes](/vault/docs/enterprise/performance-standby).
- Use [integrated storage](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage) for durable storage.
- Run [Vault Enterprise redundancy zones](/vault/docs/enterprise/redundancy-zones) to increase read scaling and resiliency.
- Use [Vault Enterprise multi-datacenter replication](/vault/docs/internals/replication) for high availability and scalability through a primary/secondary (1:N) asynchronous model. 

## Next steps

In this document, you learned about the HashiCorp resources for implementing and running a reliable Vault cluster. The following are implementation guides on the other HashiCorp products.

- [Packer implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-packer-reliability)
- [Terraform implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-terraform-reliability)
- [Consul implementation resources](/well-architected-framework/implementation-resources/implementation-resources-consul-reliability)
