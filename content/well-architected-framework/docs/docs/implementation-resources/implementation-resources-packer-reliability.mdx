# Run a reliable Packer pipeline

This document outlines implementation resources for maintaining reliable Packer pipelines. When you implement proper reliability measures, you ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and consistent performance of your Packer pipelines.

## Automation

Implement automation to build consistent and secure images.

- [Build a golden image pipeline with HCP Packer](/packer/tutorials/cloud-production/golden-image-with-hcp-packer) to allow developers to focus on the application instead of system dependencies and patches.
- Automate Packer with [GitHub Actions](/packer/tutorials/cloud-production/github-actions) and Packer templates.
- Run unattended installations for [Debian](/packer/guides/automatic-operating-system-installs/preseed_ubuntu) and [Windows](/packer/guides/automatic-operating-system-installs/autounattend_windows).

## Compliance

Enforce your organization's compliance best practices and revoke compromised artifacts.

- Schedule [artifact version revocation](/packer/tutorials/hcp/hcp-schedule-image-iterations-revocation).
- Identify [compromised artifacts with HCP Terraform](/packer/tutorials/hcp/run-tasks-data-source-image-validation).
- Enforce [artifact compliance with HCP Terraform](/packer/tutorials/hcp/run-tasks-resource-image-validation).
- Revoke [an artifact and its descendants using inherited revocation with HCP Terraform](/packer/tutorials/hcp/revoke-image).

## Next steps

In this document, you learned about the HashiCorp resources for implementing and running a reliable Packer pipeline. The following are implementation guides on the other HashiCorp products.
