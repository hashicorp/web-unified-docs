# Waypoint Config set

Command: `waypoint config set`

Set a config variable.

@include "commands/config-set_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint config set <name>=<value>`

Set a config variable that will be available to deployments as an
environment variable.

This will scope the variable to the entire project by default.
Specify the "-app" flag to set a config variable for a specific app.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-workspace=<string>` - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-runner` - Expose this configuration on runners. This can be used to set things such as credentials to cloud platforms for remote runners. This configuration will not be exposed to deployed applications.
