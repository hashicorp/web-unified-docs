# Waypoint Status

Command: `waypoint status`

List and refresh application statuses.

@include "commands/status_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint status [options] [project]`

View the current status of projects, applications, and their resources
managed by Waypoint.

When the '-refresh' flag is included, this command will attempt to regenerate
every requested application's status report on-demand for both local and remote
data sourced projects.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.

#### Command Options

- `-verbose` (`-V`) - Display more details.
- `-json` - Output the status information as JSON.
- `-all-projects` - Output status about every project in a workspace.
- `-refresh` - Refresh application status for the requested app or apps in a project.
