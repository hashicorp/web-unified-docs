# Tips and Troubleshooting

## Remove the Waypoint Server

The Waypoint Server creates several resources in Docker and Kubernetes that should be removed to either reinstall Waypoint or to completely remove it from a system.

### Waypoint Server in Docker

Ensure that you have the latest `hashicorp/waypoint` Docker image.

```shell-session
$ docker pull hashicorp/waypoint:latest
```

`waypoint install` for Docker creates a container and a volume. These resources should be removed when Waypoint Server is no longer needed. These are some example `docker` commands that should clean up after a Waypoint Server installation.

```shell-session
$ docker stop waypoint-server
$ docker rm waypoint-server
$ docker volume prune -f
```

### Waypoint Server in Kubernetes

`waypoint install` for Kubernetes creates a StatefulSet, Service and PersistentVolumeClaim. These resources should be removed when Waypoint Server is no longer needed. These are some example `kubectl` commands that should clean up after a Waypoint Server installation.

```shell-session
$ kubectl delete statefulset waypoint-server
$ kubectl delete pvc data-waypoint-server-0
$ kubectl delete svc waypoint
```

## Pack Builder No Such Image

If the `pack` builder exits during build with an error similar to:

```
Â» Building...
Creating new buildpack-based image using builder: heroku/buildpacks:18
...
! failed to create 'detector' container: Error response from daemon: No such
  image: pack.local/builder/6c647962686577687270:latest
```

You may need to remove the Docker volumes that are responsible for storing cached images for pack.

```shell-session
$ docker volume list
...
```

Locate the volumes named starting with `pack-cache-` and remove them with `docker volume rm`.
