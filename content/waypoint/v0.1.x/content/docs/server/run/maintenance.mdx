# Server Maintenance

A Waypoint server needs to be maintained to ensure smooth operation and
to protect against unexpected events such as server crashes. This page
outlines various maintenance-related topics for smooth operation of a
Waypoint server.

## Logs

Server logs are output to `stderr`.

For `waypoint install`-based servers, logs are always very verbose (`-vvv`).
For manually run servers, you can control log level using multiple `-v` flags
or by setting `WAYPOINT_LOG_LEVEL` to one of "trace", "debug", "info", "warn",
or "error".

## Database

The Waypoint server stores data into a single `data.db` file.

### Path to Database

For `waypoint install`-based servers:

- **Docker** - `/data/data.db`
- **Kubernetes** - `/data/data.db`
- **Nomad** - `/alloc/data.db`

For manually run servers, it is dependent on the value of the `-db` flag.

### Backup / Restore

Backup and restore currently require that the server is not running.

While the server is offline, you can copy or replace the database file
to perform a backup and restore.

-> Online backup and restore will be supported in a future release.
