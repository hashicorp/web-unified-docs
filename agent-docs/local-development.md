# Local development

Local development splits by audience.

## Educators

Educators primarily make `content/` changes and run the full local preview
through Docker with `make`:

```sh
make
make clean
```

## Developers

Developers work on application or tooling code and run the project locally with
`npm`:

```sh
npm run prebuild
npm run dev
```

`npm run prebuild` populates the `public/` folder and only needs to run once
(or when prebuild sources change — see `scripts/prebuild/**` or
`productConfig.mjs`). It is a long-running process; run it manually when
needed rather than before every `npm run dev`.

## Runtime

The repo uses Next.js and requires Node `>=24` (see `package.json` `engines`).
