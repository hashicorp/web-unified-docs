# Screenshots

These guidelines describe when and how to use screenshots in your content.


## Avoid screenshots in documentation 

- **keywords**: visual aids, screenshots
- **content sets**: docs

HashiCorp UIs change too frequently and are a maintenance burden. Concise descriptions of the user workflow are simpler to keep up to date. Work worth your technical writer to determine when a screenshot may be necessary. 

## Add screenshots to tutorials according to the Education team's standards

- **keywords**: visual aids, screenshots
- **content sets**: tutorials, WAF, certifications

Refer to [Guidelines for alert boxes](../appendix.md#guidelines-for-alerts-boxes) for details.

## Remove the browser's URL bar and window elements from screenshots

- **keywords**: visual aids, screenshots
- **content sets**: tutorials, WAF, certifications

If you must include screenshots, crop out the address bar and other browser elements so that readers can focus on the product UI.
