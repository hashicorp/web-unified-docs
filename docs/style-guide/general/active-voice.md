# Active voice

These guidelines are intended to help you write in active voice.

## Write sentences where a subject performs an action, exhibits agency, or gets described by a predicate phrase

- **keywords**: writing, grammar, active-voice  
- **content sets**: docs, WAF, tutorials, certifications
 
### Examples

**Do**

- `Next, register the service.`
- `We recommend configuring VCS access when you set up an organization.`
- `By default, Vault expects users to own configuration directories and files that control how Vault runs.`
- `Consul is a service networking solution.`
- `Consul solves service networking issues.`

**Don't**

- `Next, the service will be registered.`
- `It is recommended to configure VCS access when first setting up an organization.`
- `By default, Vault expects that the configuration directory and files that run Vault are owned by the user.`

## Use direct, imperative statements that tell readers what to do

- **keywords**: writing, grammar, active-voice  
- **content sets**: docs, WAF, tutorials, certifications

Imperatives imply "you" as the subject. Imperatives are clear, actionable, and prevent passive voice. 

### Examples

**Do:**

The following examples imply that the subject is the second "you" :

- ``To specify the location of a configuration file, use the `-config` flag with `vault server`.``
- ``Open `main.tf` in your editor.``

The following examples explicitly instruct "you" to perform the action:

- ``You can set the `-var` flag multiple times in the same command to set additional variables.``
- ``You must provide credentials to access HCP Terraform.`` 

**Don't:**

- `The flag can be set multiple times. `
- `Next, the service will be registered.`
- `It is recommended to configure VCS access when first setting up an organization.`
