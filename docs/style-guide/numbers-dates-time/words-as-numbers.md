# Words as numbers

Follow these guidelines to write words as numbers.

## Spell out ordinal numbers such as first, second, and third 

- **keywords**: ordinal numbers
- **content sets**: docs, tutorials, WAF, certifications

Ordinal numbers are number words that describe something's position, such as first, second, and third. 

## Example

"first", not "1st" 

## Spell out numbers zero through nine 

- **keywords**: numbers, units
- **content sets**: docs, tutorials, WAF, certifications

You can use number characters when describing a technical quantity, such as computer drive capacity. Spell out number zero through nine unless describing a technical quantity. Use a non-breaking space between a numerical character and unit unless they form a compound description.  

### Examples

- "1 GB", not "one gigabyte" or "1GB" 	
- "64-bit processor", not "64 bit processor": "64-bit" is a compound word that modifies "processor"

## Use numerals for number ranges that include zero through nine

- **keywords**: numbers, ranges
- **content sets**: docs, tutorials, WAF, certifications

Write out number ranges that zero through nine and use a hyphen if the words would be confusing or difficult to read. Otherwise, use numerals and dashes to describe numeric ranges.

### Examples

**Do**:

- `Ports 8000 - 9000 must be open.`	
- `Restart all clients in zones from two to four.`

**Don't**:

- `Ports 8000 to 9000 must be open`
- `Restart all clients in zones from 2 - 4.`
