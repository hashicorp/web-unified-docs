 *
 * This likely relates to older versions of Sentinel docs still using
 * the `pages` directory to store content... `mktg-content-workflows`

 * to account for it as well.

 * Or...  would be nice to not have to deal with these cases?
 *
 * Maybe during the process of migrating docs to this repo, we standardize
 * the directory structure? As long as the API routes are still drop-in
 * replacements for the previous API, maybe that'd make sense... rather than
 * migrating repo-config, we migrate in a way that requires less (maybe zero)
 * "repo-config".
