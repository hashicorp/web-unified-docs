 * This is intended as a SEPARATE script, not used in main migration scripts.

 * Intent here is to provide a convenience for testing out migrations across
 * all content source repositories. Rather than having to wait for individual
 * repos to clone as you test each one individually, you can start this script,
 * walk away and have a beverage or nutrition break or whatever, and come back
 * to a snappier content migration testing experience.
 *
 * We start with a shallow clone for each repo, but we also fetch the known
 * release refs from the existing content API, and check those out too.
 * This makes subsequent checking out of refs a lil faster. It also takes a LOT
 * longer than just shallow cloning, but since the intent is to leave this
 * running while you go about other things, it feels worth the tradeoff.
