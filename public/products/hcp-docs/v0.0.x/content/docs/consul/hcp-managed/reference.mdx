# HashiCorp-managed cluster configuration reference

This page provides reference information about the properties of HashiCorp-managed clusters.

Refer to [Create a HashiCorp-managed cluster](/hcp/docs/consul/hcp-managed/create) for instructions and additional guidance.

## Cluster configuration reference

The following configuration options are available for HashiCorp-managed clusters:

| Attribute             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Default                                  | Can edit after cluster creation |

| Cluster ID            | A name that serves as a unique identifier for your cluster. This value cannot be the same as other active HCP Consul clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `consul-cluster`                         | &#10060; |
| Cluster size          | Specifies the vCPU and GiB RAM configurations. Each size corresponds to a number of service instances. Extra small is only available on the development tier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Small                                    | &#9989; |
| Cluster tier          | Four tiers are available: <br /><br />**Development:** Lowest tier designed for testing purposes.<br /><br />**Standard:** Middle tier designed for production workloads located in a single region.<br /><br />**Plus:** Higher tier designed for production workloads spanning multiple regions.<br /><br />**Premium:** Highest tier designed for production workloads spanning multiple cloud providers.<br /><br />For more details, refer to [cluster tiers](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-tiers). | Development                              |  &#10060; |
| Consul version        | Specifies the Consul version deployed to the cluster. If your environment does not require a specific version, we recommend you use the default version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Latest GA version                        |  &#9989; |
| Network               | Specifies the HVN that contains the cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Defaults to the first HVN listed in HCP. |  &#10060; |
| Network accessibility | Enables access to the Consul UI through a public endpoint. For production use cases, we recommend that you disable public accessibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Disabled                                 |  &#10060; |
