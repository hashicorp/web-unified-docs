# Create and Manage an HVN

You can create and manage a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) for AWS. Use an HVN to delegate an IPv4 CIDR range to HCP. The platform uses this CIDR range to automatically create a virtual private cloud (VPC).

## Specification

- You can create one HVN for each available cloud region.
- Resources added to an HVN appear in the HVN's cloud region. Deploying a cluster into an HVN created in the us-east-1 region, for example, adds the cluster to the us-east-1 region.
- All HCP resources must be located in one HVN. A single product deployment cannot span two different HVNs.
- You cannot move product deployments from one HVN to another.
- You cannot change HVNs after you deploy them.


## Create an HVN

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](/hcp?utm_source=docs) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click **Create network**.
1. Name your virtual network.
1. Select **Amazon Web Services** as your provider.
1. Select a region from the dropdown menu.
    - One HVN can be created in each available cloud region.
    - Resources added to the HVN later are added in the same region.
1. Optionally, specify a CIDR block. To learn more, click **Show recommendations**.
1. Click **Create network**.

> **Tutorial**: For additional guidance on how to create an HVN, complete the [HashiCorp Virtual Network tutorials](/hcp/tutorials/networking?utm_source=docs).

## Connect an HVN to AWS

To connect your Hashicorp Virtual Network to your AWS infrastructure, you must first create either a peering connection or a transit gateway attachment. Then, specify traffic routes so that clusters can communicate with client resources. Individual configuration instructions are available:

* [Peering Connections](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-peering)
* [Transit Gateway Attachments](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/tgw-attach)
* [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/routes)
* [Security Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/security-groups)

## Manage an HVN

You cannot modify HVNs after you deploy them, but the following management features are available.

### Import to Terraform

HCP generates a command that you can copy and run to import and manage the HVN in Terraform:

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](/hcp?utm_source=docs) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. From the **Manage** menu, copy the provided `terraform import` command.
1. Open your terminal and run the command.

### Delete an HVN

1. Sign in to the [HCP Portal](/hcp) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. From the **Manage** menu, click **Delete**.
1. When prompted, select **Confirm**.
