# HCP Vault multi-region support

HCP Vault supports delivering your Vault cluster to multiple regions with just a
few steps. Delivering your Vault cluster to multiple regions allows you to
support applications that are delivered globally and reduces latency to
your secrets.

<Note>
Clusters can have up to five performance replication secondary clusters.

If you have already reached your overall Vault cluster quota, you will not be able to
create additional secondary clusters. 
If you need to increase the overall quota, please follow the process to
[request additional resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support#request-additional-resources).
</Note>

## What is performance replication?

Performance replication allows the Vault functionalities such as identity
management, secrets storage, and policy management to scale across the regions.
This lets Vault clients read and write secrets from an HCP Vault cluster closest
to them. 

![Performance Replication](/img/docs/perf-replication.png)

It operates on a leader/follower model, wherein a leader cluster (known as a
**primary**) is linked to its follower **secondary** cluster. The primary
cluster acts as the system of record and asynchronously replicates most Vault
data.

The secondary cluster keeps track of their own tokens and leases but shares the
underlying configuration (e.g., auth method configuration), policies, and
secrets. If a user action modifies the underlying shared state, the
secondary forwards the request to the primary and the changes are transparent to
the client.

<Warning>

Both the primary and secondary clusters must be created in the [HashiCorp
Virtual Networks (HVNs)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) of the same
[project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects). Performance replication will not work
across projects.

</Warning>
