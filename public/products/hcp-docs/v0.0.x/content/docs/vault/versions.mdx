# Version management

Currently, HashiCorp maintains all clusters on the most recent major and minor versions of HCP Vault. Within a major release family, the most recent stable minor version will be automatically maintained for all tiers. Major versions are automatically maintained for the Development and Starter tiers. For Standard and Plus tiers, users are able to:
- set a maintenance window in which HCP Vault will attempt to upgrade their cluster to the most recent available major version
- defer upgrade, and opt to upgrade manually up to 30 days from the time of availability of the latest version.

When a specific Vault version approaches its end-of-life on the HCP, existing users
will receive a notification to upgrade to a supported version.
