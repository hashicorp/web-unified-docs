# Write global ignore rules

HCP Vault Radar Ignore rules allow you to ignore certain events based on a set of rules.  


## Edit global ignore rules

1. Select **Settings/Global Ignore Rules**.

1. Enter the Ignore rules as YAML and update.

The updated ignore rules do not impact the existing events but will reflect on events from future scans. The next time you run a reconciliation scan, on-demand scan, PR webhook scan, or similar, the events will change based on the updated ignore rules.
