# config

Command: `vlt config`

The `config` command displays the organization ID, project ID and the
application name that the CLI is currently configured to target. If
flags are specified it will update the current config.

### Examples

```shell-session
$ vlt config
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
App Name: vault-edu-secrets
Project ID: 0011a1aa-22bb-33cc-d44d-555eee555e55
Organization ID: 11aa1a11-22b2-33cc-4dd4-5555ee666666
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If no config has been found, the user will be prompted to run `vlt config init`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
No configuration has been found. Try running `vlt config init`
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The example shows that the CLI is currently pointing to the `vault-edu-secrets`
application.

To update config values the user can provide a flag to override the value.

```shell-session
$ vlt config -a my-new-app
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
App Name: my-new-app
Project ID: 0011a1aa-22bb-33cc-d44d-555eee555e55
Organization ID: 11aa1a11-22b2-33cc-4dd4-5555ee666666
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If the app name can't be verified the message will reflect that. 

<Tip>

The CLI will verify any values that are being updated and will not update
if an organization id, project id or app name provided can't be validated.

</Tip>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
app name provided could not be found
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
