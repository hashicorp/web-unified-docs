  In addition to a verbose HTTP API, HCP Vault Secrets features a command-line interface
  that wraps common functionality and formats output. The CLI is a single
  static binary. It is a thin wrapper around the HTTP API. Every CLI command
  maps directly to the HTTP API internally.

# Commands (CLI)

HCP Vault Secrets provides a command-line interface (CLI) that wraps common
functionality and formats the outputs. 

Each command is represented as a command or subcommand, and there are a number
of command and subcommand options available: HTTP options, output options, and
command-specific options.

<Note title="Download and install CLI">

The HCP Vault Secrets CLI tool is available for download from
[releases.hashicorp.com/vlt](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vlt/). Refer to the
[Install HCP Vault Secrets
CLI](/vault/tutorials/hcp-vault-secrets-get-started/hcp-vault-secrets-install-cli)
tutorial for a step-by-step instruction.

   ```shell-session
   $ vlt apps create --description="This app stores the API key for WebApp" webapp
   Successfully created app with name webapp
   ```

1. Create a secret for the application using the [`secrets
   create`](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/commands/secrets/create) command.

   ```shell-session
   $ vlt secrets create --app-name="webapp" apikey="123WEOIN381$%847"

   ```

1. Retrieve the secret value using the [`secrets
   get`](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/commands/secrets/create) command.

   ```shell-session
