# login 

Command: `vlt login` 

Use the `login` command to authenticate users or machines with HCP Vault
Secrets. 

The default functionality is to open a web browser and manage authentication
through the user's HCP account. Alternatively, you can set the [HCP service
principal key
pair](/hcp/docs/hcp/security/service-principals#generate-a-service-principal-key)
(client ID and secret ID) as an environment variable to perform headless login.

- `HCP_CLIENT_ID` - set the value to your service principal client ID 
- `HCP_CLIENT_SECRET` - set the value to your service principal client secret 


### Examples

By default, login will launch a web browser to perform HCP login.

```shell-session
$ vlt login

Failed to read cache from file: failed to read file from user's credential path: open /Users/student/.config/hcp/credentials.json: no such file or directory
Failed to read cache from file: failed to read file from user's credential path: open /Users/student/.config/hcp/credentials.json: no such file or directory
No credentials found, proceeding with browser login.
The default web browser has been opened at https://auth.idp.hashicorp.com/oauth2/auth. Please continue the login in the web browser.
Success!
Successfully logged in
```

You may close the browser and return to the command line.

<Tip>

First, it looks for the `credentials.json` file to see if there is cached
credentials. If not, it will launch a web browser.

</Tip>


Alternatively, you can preset the client ID and client secret environment
variables.

```shell-session
$ export HCP_CLIENT_ID="<MY_CLIENT_ID>"
$ export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET="<MY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
```

And the, run the `login` command.

```shell-session
$ vlt login
Successfully logged in
```
