# Structure guide - organizing your secrets

There are many ways you could organize your secrets inside your organization.
This guide will walk you through our recommended approach to do so. 

The best way to think about organizing secrets is to think of the isolation and
access boundaries you want to setup for your secrets. 

## Example scenario

You have an application named **DreamCommerce** with two services: `PaymentsAPI`
and `WebSearch`. Each service has a dedicated team to develop; however, both
services use the same underlying APIs with shared secrets. The DreamCommerce
application and its services have four environments: development, CI, staging,
and production.

### Projects and applications

An HCP organization can have one or more [HCP
projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) to segment HCP resource access within an
organization, such as by team, use cases, or environment (development, staging,
production, etc.). You can set [user
permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#user-permissions) at the project level.

To ensure the production environment has a separate isolation and access
boundary, create separate HCP projects with clear naming convention such as:

- **DreamCommerce-NonProd** - a project to manage non-production HCP resources
- **DreamCommerce-Prod** - a project to manage production HCP resources

<Tip>

Within each project, create HCP Vault Secrets applications for the combination
of services and deployment environments.

#### DreamCommerce-NonProd

Under the DreamCommerce-NonProd project, create HCP Vault Secrets applications
with following naming convention: `<SERVICE_NAME>-<ENVIRONMENT>`.

| Application name       | Service name | Environment / Usage |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `payments-api-dev`     | PaymentsAPI  | development         |
| `payments-api-ci`      | PaymentsAPI  | CI                  |
| `payments-api-staging` | PaymentsAPI  | staging             |
| `web-search-dev`       | WebSearch    | development         |
| `web-search-ci`        | WebSearch    | CI                  |
| `web-search-staging`   | WebSearch    | staging             |


#### DreamCommerce-Prod

For production, create an HCP Vault Secrets application per service. 
In addition, create a dedicated application for the CI automation tool to
isolate two different types of clients.

| Application name  | Service name | Environment / Usage |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `payments-api`    | PaymentsAPI  | production          |
| `web-search`      | WebSearch    | production          |
| `payments-api-ci` | PaymentsAPI  | CI                  |
| `web-search-ci`   | WebSearch    | CI                  |

#### Summary

Organizing your HCP Vault Secrets applications in this convention allows you to
set granular control over which clients (users or systems) have access to the
production environment while the non-production environments continue to support
the engineering effort.
