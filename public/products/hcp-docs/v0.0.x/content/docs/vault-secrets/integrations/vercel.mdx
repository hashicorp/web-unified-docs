# Integrate with Vercel

<Note>

Vercel integrations must be installed from within HCP Vault Secrets. Integrations
created from Vercel Marketplace are currently not supported.

</Note>

HCP Vault Secrets allows users to automatically synchronize application secrets
to a Vercel Project. This guide walks you through the configuration process.

## Prerequisites:

- An Admin role in an HCP Project
- An HCP Vault Secrets application and secret(s)

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the HCP Vault Secrets app you would like to integrate with your
   Vercel project. From the sidebar, select **Integrations** then click on the
   **Vercel** card to initiate the setup in a second window.

1. Select either a team or a personal Vercel Account to add the
   [integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/hcp-vault-secrets) to.

1. Select one or more projects you want to authorize HCP Vault Secrets to
   access. You can modify this list any time from the
   [Vercel integrations dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations).

1. Click **Add Integration** to complete the installation. The window will close
   and the installation process will complete automatically on the HashiCorp
   Cloud Platform.

   <Note>
   
   If the installation process encounters an unexpected error, you can always uninstall the Vercel integration in your
   [Vercel integrations dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations) and try again.
       
   </Note>

1. Select the project and the deployment target where you want to sync your
   app's secrets.

1. Once all fields are populated, click **Save and sync secrets** to complete
   the configuration process. It will immediately sync all your existing app
   secrets into your selected Vercel project.
