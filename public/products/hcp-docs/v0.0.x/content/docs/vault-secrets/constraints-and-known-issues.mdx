# Known issues

Here are some known issues and limitations with HCP Vault Secrets today.

### GitHub sync integration limitations

* You can only create new GitHub sync integrations from HCP Vault Secrets, and they cannot be triggered from the GitHub marketplace
* You can only sync secrets from a single HCP Project to GitHub. 
* You can only sync secrets to a single GitHub Organization. 

### Vercel sync limitations

* You can only create new Vercel Sync Integrations from HCP Vault Secrets, and they cannot be triggered from the Vercel marketplace
* You can only sync secrets from a single HCP Project to Vercel. 
* You can only sync secrets to a single Vercel Account.


### Deleting integrations

You can delete integrations via the [API](/hcp/api-docs/vault-secrets#DeleteSyncIntegration) only. 

### Unintended disconnection of sync integrations from app in API

There is a known bug with the raw API where a PATCH request to edit an App's Description without also passing the `sync_integrations` field will result in all sync integrations being disconnected from the Application. To get around this, edit your App's Description in the UI or CLI, or pass your App's existing integrations in as part of your PATCH request body even though you aren't changing them.

If you accidentally disconnect your App's integrations this way, you can attach them again with a second PATCH request, as the integrations were not deleted, just disconnected.

### Audit log for integrations

Currently, HCP Vault Secrets only shows the Force Sync event on the [audit
logs](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/activity-logs). Other events related to
integrations won't show up on audit logs.
