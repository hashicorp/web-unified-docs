## pack (builder)

Create a Docker image using CloudNative Buildpacks.

### Interface

- Input: **component.Source**
- Output: **pack.Image**

### Mappers

#### Allow pack images to be used as normal docker images

- Input: **pack.Image**
- Output: **docker.Image**

### Variables

#### builder

The buildpack builder image to use.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**
- Default: heroku/buildpacks:18

#### disable_entrypoint

If set, the entrypoint binary won't be injected into the image.

The entrypoint binary is what provides extended functionality such as logs and exec. If it is not injected at build time the expectation is that the image already contains it.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### static_environment

Environment variables to expose to the buildpack.

These environment variables should not be run of the mill configuration variables, use waypoint config for that. These variables are used to control over all container modes, such as configuring it to start a web app vs a background worker.

- Type: **map[string]string**
- **Optional**

### Examples

```

build {
  use "pack" {
	builder     = "heroku/buildpacks:18"
	disable_entrypoint = false
  }
}

```
