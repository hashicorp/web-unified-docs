# Waypoint Logs

Command: `waypoint logs`

Show log output from an application's current deployment

@include "commands/logs_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `waypoint logs [options]`

Show log output from all current deployments.

The logs will include output from deployments that aren't released.
As new deployments are made, their logs will appear automatically.

The six character text after the date on a log line is the last six
characters of the instance ID. This can be used to trace any logs back
to a specific deployment or filter out certain log messages.

#### Global Options

- `-plain` - Plain output: no colors, no animation.
- `-app=<string>` (`-a`) - App to target. Certain commands require a single app target for Waypoint configurations with multiple apps. If you have a single app, then this can be ignored.
- `-project=<string>` (`-p`) - Project to target.
- `-workspace=<string>` (`-w`) - Workspace to operate in.
