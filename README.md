# Web Unified Docs

> **Please note**: ðŸš¨ The `public` folder in this repository is served on the public internet, as this project is now [deployed through Vercel](https://vercel.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs/deployments). Please exercise caution when testing content migration scripts, _especially_ when pushing your work up. For the majority of content source repositories, this presents very little risk, as the content source repositories themselves are already public.
>
> However, some content source repositories are _not_ public. Specifically:
>
> - [hcp-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-docs)
> - [ptfe-releases](https://github.com/hashicorp/ptfe-releases)
> - [sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel)
>
> For these repositories in particular, please take care to ensure that only the content that is already published through our `content.hashicorp.com` API is migrated into this repository.

The project in this repository, `hashicorp/web-unified-docs`, aims to implement [[DEVDOT-023] Unified Product Documentation Repository](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8kOqySttvWUVfn7qiC4wGBR73LMBGMelwLt69pM3FQ/edit). The RFC for this project was intentionally light on implementation details, in order to foster consensus on the broad direction.

The existing API (`content.hashicorp.com`) has endpoints that serve documentation content, the source code for which can be found in [hashicorp/mktg-content-workflows](https://github.com/hashicorp/mktg-content-workflows/blob/main/api/content.ts). The endpoints related to documentation content will be replaced with a new API as part of this project.

## Local Development

### Requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 20 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (for managing containers)

### Setting Up Environment Variables

There are a few things you need to set up before you can begin developing in this repository.

1. [Install the Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli)

   The CLI is needed for the next 2 steps.

2. Run `vercel link`

   This command will prompt you to connect your local copy of repo to [the Vercel `web-unified-docs` project](<[https://vercel.com/hashicorp/dev-portal](https://vercel.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs)>). The command creates a `.vercel` directory with a JSON file that contains the information that links to the Vercel project.

3. Run `vercel env pull .env`

   This command will pull the development environment variables from the linked Vercel project and write them to a new `.env` file.

### Terminology

- `migration | migration-preview` - A preview of `hashicorp/dev-portal` where some routes fetch data from the existing content API and whilst only the routes that have been intentionally migrated use the new unified docs api ie this repo.
- `unified-docs | unified-docs-preview` - A preview of `hashicorp/dev-portal` where it pulls all of its content from the new unified docs api ie this repo.

### Quick Start

To get a migration preview running, run `make` from the root of this repo. Once this command completes the following endpoints should be working:

- http://localhost:3000 - A running instance of the current dev-portal frontend application that is configured to pull content from the local `public` direcotry.

- http://localhost:8000 - An instance of the content API endpoint that serves content from the local `public` directory. Here is example of a request http://localhost:8080/api/content/terraform/doc/v1.1.x/cli that can be used to test this endpoint.

To spin this down gracefully, run `make clean` in a separate terminal. If you wish to remove the local Docker images as well, you can specify `make clean CLEAN_OPTION=full`.

### More Commands

The `makefile` serves as a convenience tool to get a migration preview running. If you need more granular control a full list of the commands are available in the `package.json` file.
To use these you will need to intentionally run `npm install` and `npm run prebuild` before anything else.

Running test coverage `npm run coverage`

## Background

### Project Ratoinale

- Storing documentation in one branch of one repo dramatically simplifies the workflow for contributing documentation.
- Publishing changes to multiple versions can be done in a single PR, as opposed to multiple PRs which is required by the current setup.
- Finding and making the same change across multiple versions is as simple as doing a find-and-replace since all the versioned docs are on the filesystem at the same time.
- Adding a new product is as easy as making a new folder, as opposed to the current process which requires code-changes on the API side and the installation of a GitHub App to monitor for events.
- Sourcing from one branch in one repo eliminates the situation where a missed GitHub event can result in out-of-date documentation. If something goes wrong in the publishing process, simply run it again instead of relying on incoming commit/release events from the GitHub API.
- Since we can make edits to all docs for all products and versions from a single PR, making platform-level changes is dramatically simplified (such as updating to MDX v2, or rewriting URLs).
- Adding new features like content conformance (basically linting for docs) can be done for the entire codebase at once.
- Removes the ability for docs to break the release workflow in product repos.
- Enables us to support fully versioned deployment previews, whereas current previews are limited to the branch being modified.

### Clone Time

As of writing, cloning this repo takes about the same amount of time as cloning a single one of our larger repos.
